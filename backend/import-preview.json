    "description": "Jet Set Radio (2000) is an action game that allows players to dive into the atmosphere of teenager gangs of early 2000s Tokyo. The action is set in a 3D fictionalized Tokyo torn by teen gangs clash. Things clarify when Professor K, DJ of the Tokyo-to pirate radio station announces a gang war between Japanese rudies (teenagers, who skate and paint graffiti for self-expression). According to the main idea, teens skate and paint graffiti spots throughout the city and dodge police forces. The story is following a 17-year-old rudie Beat, who, being inspired by Professor K, organizes his own gang to burst into the conflict and to defeat rivals. The gameplay is about skating across the city (using only a few buttons) and tagging all possible graffiti spots. In the course of the game, players will face troubles caused by police riots and especially Capitan Onishima (the main antagonist), whose only aim is to pursue the rebellion of the youth. Jet Set Radio also features cel-shaded visuals in favor of 3D cartoon-like picture.",

It is the ninth installment in the series.\n\n###Plot\nAn unnamed journalist investigates the Mishima family history after his family got killed in a war that was started by Jin Kazama. In his investigation, the journalist tries to find out why did Jin's grandfather kill his own wife and threw his son Kazuya down the cliff. At the same time, Jin goes into hiding after defeating an ancient demon named Azazel while his grandfather takes over Mishima Zaibatsu. The world war goes on.\n\n###Gameplay\nJust like the previous games in the series (apart from Tekken Tag Tournament 1 & 2), Tekken 7's gameplay revolves around one-on-one hand-to-hand fights. \n\nPlayers are free to choose one of 43 playable characters. Every character has their own personal list of attacks and combos and drastically differs in play style.\n\nSeveral new additions were made to the game's combat system. Players can now use devastating hits that will take from 40 to 80 percent of the enemy's health if the player's health drops too low. Moreover, the players are able to use a Rage Drive. It allows for performing a special hit on a high speed that inflicts major damage to the enemy. The last new addition is Power Crush. This feature lets the players attack their opponent even when they're under attack. Players can't block their enemies low kicks while using the Power Crush.",

Seventh in the series. It presents the crews and pilots who participated directly in this season. Unlike its predecessors, the game received a new engine, improved physics and graphics.\n\nA \"Pro Season\" mode was featured. This mode was different from the usual championship in a complete lack of interface and management assistance, as well as the highest level of complexity. The career mode, which was in the previous parts of the series, did not appear in the game.\n\nThe game is also compatible with the voice recognition  (available only on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One). With its help, players will be able to communicate with their teams during the race and learn about the weather changes, the condition of the car and tires, and to request an unscheduled change of tires.",

Headsnatchers has 25 ridiculous maps with unique, yet unlikely, weapons and features, with their own steps and rules to follow. Well, they’re more like guidelines. Nobody likes rules. Dunk your buddies’ heads through hoops like LeBron, kick your grandpa’s gobbler through a portal to hell like Doomguy™ and flush your sister’s brain-basket down the toilet like the dooky you pushed out five hours after you shoved that XL pizza down your face.

With over 100 unique heads to choose from, there’s a head for everyone. Did we mention there are pop culture references? There’s a head that resembles that one angry guy from that anime you used to love, and one from a children's show with a certain mathematically challenged Count. If you don’t like any of those, make your own heads using the Headitor! You can save up to 20 heads, so go nuts trying to recreate those school dweebs who used to pick you last for gym.\nA SINGLE-PLAYER MODE MADE JUST FOR YOU\nSometimes you just need a little me-time - we totally get it. Rip it up in the single-player Zombie Castle-mode! This single-player feature spans across three different difficulty levels. “But, my dudes, every game has multiple difficulties nowadays”, we hear you thinking. Zombie Castle is different throughout its easy, normal and hard modes. Different levels, different everything, same zombies. We’re calling it right now: you can’t beat them all. Probably.OBLIGATORY KEY FEATURE BULLET POINTS\nWe’re sorry, but we just have to go over all of the features one last time.

After getting banished by the society, the main character finds himself all alone. Three exiles soon approach him and invite the protagonist to party with them and nickname him the Reader. The group sets out to cleanse their souls.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe gameplay of Pyre revolves around some sports game, which is connected with a ritual known as the Rites, which happens in a parallel world. The Protagonist controls his three newly found friends in battles against three opponents on a small arena. Each team has its own pyre. Both pyres oppose each other. The objective of the game is to defend your pyre while attacking the enemy one. The player can only destroy the pyre with the orb, that is spawned in the center of the arena and which has to be grabbed and thrown into the pyre.\n\nDuring a round, the Reader can switch between the character he wants to control and pass the orb from one to another. Each player has their own amount of endurance which is required for moving around the arena. If the players of a team come together, they create a zone that is dangerous for the player that carries the orb. If the player with the orb should get into that zone, they'll be temporarily removed from the game.\n\nWhile free from the Rites, the player can travel through the world of Pyre, train his teammates or try to learn more about the Rites.",

But there are also essential Sims-like attributes like hunger and happiness that wear down during activities and need to be replenished. Money is also essential and can be earned by performing jobs and quests or by winning boxing matches. Before each fight, be it a match or an assault by a street gang, you choose a number of skills that the boxer will use this time. Completing quests will earn you favors from the other characters that will help you to advance the central plot and find the murderer.",

The higher your rank becomes, the more cars become available.  \nWhile DiRT 3 and the series in general is famous for its responsive controls and simple physics that make these games easy to master for newcomers, DiRT 3 features a quite challenging new mode - gymkhana. In this mode, you need to perform different tricks in a limited time period, such as drifting, jumping or spinning around. Gymkhana rounds are unskippable to progress in the career mode. Another key feature that highlights DiRT 3 is flashbacks - the mechanics that allows turning back time if you made a mistake during the race and driving a certain piece of the track again.",

According to its owner, it is hidden under a video game store and is kept secret so that if the government outlaws gambling one day, it will know nothing of Inventory. The player does not control any of the characters but is instead an invisible character on its own, who is literally referred to as The Player by other characters. \nAll players have a reserve of $10,000 at the beginning and leave the game if they're left nothing to put at stake. The ultimate goal for the player is to remain the last one sitting behind the table. Sometimes the opponents will put their recognizable belongings, such as Heavy's iconic bazooka Iron Curtain, at stake. This is essentially a board game, however, funny animation and characters' chit-chat filled with references and jokes may keep one interested.\nAchievements in Poker Night at the Inventory allow unblocking certain special features in Team Fortress 2.",

    "description": "Fishing Planet is a free realistic multiplayer first-person fishing simulator. The game has quite a few fans who are online and offline sharing tips on how to catch, for example, a Grass Pickerel. In the virtual store, the player must buy equipment and bait for virtual currency. The latter can be obtained in two ways: from the sale of caught fish or for real money. The developers tried to make the pay-to-win mechanics in the game present but not interferштп with the main gameplay. As a result, you can play the game without cash investments.\n\nFor fishing, there are available reservoirs of North America from Florida to California, new locations developers add to the add-ons, which for the game regularly come out. In August of 2018, several European reservoirs were added. For the catch are available more than 72 species of fish, each species with its own habitat characteristics and unique behavior, the game also simulates the physical properties of the rods, allowing players to perform different techniques of hacking and fishing.\n\nThe chat is available, and online tournaments are held continuously, the results of which players often receive real prizes.",

    "title": "Out There Somewhere",
    "description": "Out There Somewhere is where Portal puzzles meet retro platforming. It begins with a scrolling shooter level at which you pilot a spaceship, but the main part of the game is completely different. The player controls the protagonist named Yuri, who crash-landed on an alien planet and is searching for the villainous Grigori who destroyed his ship. Yuri is armed with a portal gun, a device that will teleport the character to where its projectile hits a wall. Unlike in Portal, you can teleport to almost any surface as long as it’s a solid object, the transportation is instant, and there are no lasting “doors”. \nEach level in Out There Somewhere is a small puzzle maze with an exit on the other side, and the player’s goal is to figure out how to get here. Yuri can “shoot himself” across the lava pits toward the other shore, through narrow corridors, or away from the villains. Initially, it is all about reaction, but eventually, the game introduces more complex mechanics, such as laser beams that divert or alter Yuri’s shots, and a regular gun that allows you to fight enemies. Out There Somewhere is stylized as a nostalgic 8-bit NES game with pixel-art graphic and is accompanied by a chiptune soundtrack.",

But not directly - in the process of playing baseball.\n\nYou can play six characters on seven rings.\n\nAnti-gravity ball with each stroke accelerates from the speed of the turtle to supersonic speed. Every fifth hit allows you to use a special trick. Each character in the reserve has a pair of very peculiar ways to drive the ball right into the opponent's face. For example, such techniques as acceleration or deceleration of the ball. As a result of using these techniques, the game can obviously become much shorter or stretch in time.\n\nThere are three game modes. Online, estra and versus.\n\nNetwork mode tracks players with a legal copy of LL. This mode allows you to find an opponent with geolocation. Knowing the location of the proposed enemy, you can choose for the fight those whom you know.\n\nThe second option \"extra\" allows you to compete with the computer, improve your playing skills and the speed of reaction to the ball flying towards the face. Also this option allows you to pump your team, opening new skill levels and increasing the palette of skins.\n\nThe third option makes it possible to form teams for the game \"two vs two\", which gives dynamics to a murderous match.",

Despite the simplicity of the concept and of the controls, the game is very competitive, and many media called the game one of the best multiplayer experience of 2014. The name is consonant with serpent from the Norse mythology Níðhöggr, the snake appears in the game, eating the winner of the duel. The game draws inspiration from the game, which was released in 1984 - Great Swordsman, and for development used software GameMaker: Studio, which is available on Steam. Who wouldn’t want to create a game where you impale a friend, eh? \n\n###Key features\nPlayers get control over two game models that differ only in color. Controls are standard: jump, move, slide and throw the sword at your opponent. You can attack at three different heights: high, medium and low. Hit the opponent's sword to disarm the latter, and he will have to raise the sword again. The main task is to reach the end of the enemy territory. The first player who accomplished this wins. There are four different levels available for solo, local and online multiplayer. Later, the developers added new modes, like a tournament and the ability to use weapons differently.",

    "description": "BEEP is an indie 2D platformer with a heavy reliance on physics laws. Big Fat Alien developed this title, and it is the only one within the IP. The game is considered to be attractive for such titles: not only it has music written primarily for it, but also the game flow feels like the one in \"big\" games. The main reception flaw is that game suits a lot more to the mobile platforms.\nThe core gameplay feature is the ability to alter the laws of the physics. There is an anti-gravity gun to do this — other than that it is just a general side-scroller platforming gameplay: the player needs to eliminate enemies, collect orbs to discover new planets and solve various physics puzzles.\nThe story is about the robot, BEEP, , sent into the Solar System to discover new planets and the possibility of life there. Once the Beep has unraveled the new planet, he checks on its physics and flies over to the next one.",

At the beginning of the game, the players create their own character and complete a tutorial. After that, the players are put into an immersive open world where they can either hunt any animal they find or activate missions, the completion of which grants the players some amount of the in-game currency.\n\nThe game's world is resembled by an immense island that features the surroundings of Washington, United States; Australia; France. The game can be played freely, yet only five species are present in its free-to-play version.\n\nWhile hunting, it is essential for the players to use cover to avoid getting detected by their prey. Each animal has its own specific reaction to the changes in the game's world. Some animals do not sense smells as well as the others, so the players can get to the prey much closer. It is also essential to take the sound you make into account, as it may scare the animal you hunt away.\n\nFor hunting several species, it is required to use a specific weapon. The players are free to use bows on any animal they can find in the world, while the game's firearms' calibers have to be carefully picked out by the players, based on the animal.",

The game offers action racing that sometimes resembles the demolition derby in an open-world setting of Paradise City. The game has a remarkable damage system that improves the whole experience and interrupts monotonous moves across the city, which is free-to-explore for the first time in a series. With The Ultimate Box edition, developers added day/night time cycles and dynamic weather system, so graphics became much better. Changes also affected the gameplay. Now players can race and explore the entire map of the city either by car or by bike that were also added. The racing career begins at the dump, where the driver, controlled by players, gets their first car and two new bikes. Players complete races and fill the “driving license” scale to upgrade the level and to open new cars and events. The free roam mode itself is also an integral part of the gameplay: while traveling across the map drivers are able to perform various stunts and unlock special achievements for the “license” experience.",

    "description": "DiRT Showdown is not a traditional racing simulator of the DiRT series. The only similar thing that relates Showdown to the original games is a high level of graphics: developers added day/night time cycles and dynamic weather system, so the whole picture looks beautiful. This game offers an arcade physics that focus players on their positive emotions. Even the advanced damage system is only a cosmetic feature because damages don’t really affect car running performance. Everything in the game is made for the spectacle. The vehicle range was expanded: imaginary monsters specially prepared for the demolition were added to already existing licensed rally cars. Racing experience covers picturesque landscapes throughout America. All the events can be divided into four main classes (Racing, Demolition, Hoonigan, and Party) and then into numerous types. Gradual completion of the events gives money for buying new vehicles or upgrading existing ones and opens new perspectives for drivers. DiRT Showdown offers both single and multiplayer experience.",

The game is set in a fictional city named Fortune Valley. The player can choose between the three individuals to represent. The title features a real car — a total of 74 ones, and crafting system — many car parts can be tuned according to the player's liking. \nThere is a total of five challenges types: Race, Drift, Off-Road, Drag, and Runner. All the modes share the goal — to reach the finish. However, the initial purpose is altered depending on the race — sometimes one has to drift his way to the finish line, somewhere the manual transmission turns one, and the gear switching comes to be mandatory.\n\n###Plot\nPayback is one of few NFS' to feature ongoing narrative — the story of this one emphasizes the revenge theme. Three characters — Tyler, Mac, and Jess — are trying to avenge Lina who betrayed the crew from the very start.  Each member of the gang has its unique abilities — Jess, for instance, is professional intel gatherer, so she plays a role of inside agent all the time. Guys, on the other hand, are more into races, so they do the dirty job in the trio.",

You can throw spikes on the road or use turbo acceleration to break away from the pursuit. Police can block the road and summon a helicopter for help from above. \nAdditionally, Hot Pursuit features a new Autolog social system. With it, you can compete with your friends and see the statistics on every race. The system compares your results with your friends' ones and notifies you every time your record is beaten.",

The game takes place 20 years after an apocalyptic event called Crossout. In 2027 a viral disease pandemic swept across the Earth, driving most people insane.

Many of the survivors have mutated, became aggressive and formed gangs to patrol the wasteland on their hand-made vehicles.\n\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player has to fight enemy characters (in PvE modes) and other players (in PvP battles) using armored cars. Victories increase the player's reputation and allow him or her to join various factions and craft their deadly weapons. There are missions the player can complete to earn more fame, money, and spare parts to customize his or her car. The game features advanced damage model, which means that any part of a vehicle can be shot off during a battle. For example a player can lose all wheels and get his car immobilized.\n\n\n###Customization\nThe game offers a variety of options for customization. Every player can assemble his or her unique car from scratch from dozens of spare parts. The cabin and the frame are the only two obligatory parts, the rest is up to the player. He or she can enhance the vehicle with weapons, armor, accelerators and other devices to fit his or her driving style. However, the design has to be practical and balanced at least to some extent. Awkwardly built vehicles can lose control or flip over. The blueprints of crafted vehicles can be shared on the 'Exhibition', where players can like and download them, to create a similar car or improve the original design. Game also offers automatic vehicle craft system, which will build a battle machine from the parts in player's storage.",

It is inspired by the Mad Max movie series.\r\n\r\n###Plot and setting\r\nThe game is set in 2165, thirty years after the events of the original Rage. More than a century before that, the Apophis asteroid fell on Earth, causing mass destruction and driving humanity to near-extinction. The few remaining people hide in the few safe oases, while the rest of the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland raided by gangsters and evil mutants. The main protagonist is a man named Walker, who is the last ranger of the wasteland and a wielder of superhuman powers. He fights against the totalitarian organization called The Authority.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nLike in the original RAGE, the sequel emphasizes its over-the-top action. The player controls Walker from the first person view and uses his huge guns and other weapons to fight monsters. The protagonist can also drive any vehicle that can be found in the game and engage in vehicular battles. When the player is driving, the game switches to the third person view. A new feature introduced in RAGE 2 is its Overdrive system that encourages aggressive playing style. By killing multiple enemies in a short amount of time, the player can enter Overdrive mode, which increases the guns' power and the amount of loot. There is also a multiplayer mode.",

    "description": "The second part of the FlatOut series offers a variety of racing options. This part of the series has street racing as its main theme. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game includes 34 cars divided by three types: \"derby\", \"race\" and \"street\". As the player's career progresses, he or she can unlock more cars that include everything up to school buses. Each car has its unique characteristics and may require different driving styles. The player can also upgrade his or her existing vehicle instead of purchasing a new one.\n\nIn the career mode, the game includes more than 30 tracks with varied environment and length. The levels often allow more than one route to choose from at any lap. AI-controlled opponents have personalities that define their driving style. Besides the races, there are mini-games that offer the player to perform stunts.\n\n###Differences from the original game\nCompared to the first part, the sequel doubled on the number of available cars, tracks, and mini-games. FlatOut 2 also introduced longer tournaments and online multiplayer. There's also an improved physics engine. The tire grip was enhanced, making the controls more sturdy, and the cars are now less likely to bounce off the track.\n\nThere's also a ragdoll physics model that defines the movements of the driver within the car. After crashes and during the stunt mini-games the driver may even fly out of the car. In some mini-games, the goal is to throw the driver's body as far as possible or to land it on a designated target.",

There is also an Ambush races mode, where players have to escape from the police as fast as possible. Like in the original Need for Speed: Most Wanted game, cops can start to pursue the player during the race and as well as in the original players have to compete against other racers and if succeeded they instantly get their cars. The game takes place in a regular city called Fairhaven, which has a beach and an industrial district as well as the main highway. \nThe game was praised for those who are fans of Burnout series, especially because of its way of races where there is a start and finish of the race but players have an option to choose which way they want to go.",

In the beginning you can choose a driver and a car; their stats are quite similar with slight differences in speed and turning. To raise your tips you need to reach the destination on time. To earn extra money you can perform multiple tricks, including drifts, jumps, near-misses, and combos of these moves. \n\nDriving through the city isn’t that easy as it seems to be. There are numerous obstacles in your way, such as frustratingly slowly buses, that make you take risks during your maneuvers on the road.

    "description": "TrackMania Nations is an arcade-style racing game, the third installment in Nadeo’s TrackMania series. Unlike the other installments in the series, Nations is a free-to-play game that featured in-game advertising as a form of monetization. \n\n###Gameplay \nLike other TrackMania entries, Nations is a racing game with heavy emphasis on player-made content and simplified physics. There is only one car available in the game, which gives every player equal opportunities and accentuates the importance of skill over the right car choice or tuning.\nThe single-player component consists of 100 tracks that gradually get more and more difficult. There is no collision system in the game, so other players or AI opponents do not affect your car’s movement. Depending on the time it took to finish the race, the player gets bronze, silver, or gold medal. Different tracks require a certain amount of medal to unlock. \nEach of the single-player tracks is available for multiplayer alongside the custom tracks that are made with in-game track-editor. \n\n###Forever version \nIn 2008, TrackMania Nations, alongside TrackMania United got free updates with Forever added to their name. The games became network compatible and allowed United owners to play together with Nations players on certain tracks. The Nations’ physics system was updated to match that of United.",

It is the first part of the tetralogy, followed by the three sequels and one remaster. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game consists of two modes: survival and racing. The goal of the racing part is pretty much the same as in any game of its genre: to reach the finish through the variety of lap tracks. The one to finish the route first wins. There are always eight players on the map with the protagonist and seven other racers — the game does not divide players into teams, every racer plays for himself.  While the survival mode brings a new experience to the genre cause the winning player is determined not only by the amount of the damage it dealt to the others but also by surviving as long as possible. \n\n###Key features\nThe FlatOut is usually noticed for the realistic physics and the destruction mechanics, allowing the player to ruin their cars in many ways with the different types of collisions being caused by the different kinds of accidents accordingly. Apart from vehicle impacts the racing game also features realistic driver-tossing-out mechanics based on Ragdoll physics technology, which was previously used in animated cartoons and FlatOut is the first known title to utilize the engine in the video games.",

Released in 2004, it is the direct sequel to Need for Speed: Underground, and is part of the Need for Speed series, available on Microsoft Windows, Game Boy Advance, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS and mobile phones. Like its predecessor, it was also commercially successful, breaking sales records in the United Kingdom.\nThe game entails tuning cars for street races, resuming the Need for Speed: Underground storyline. Need for Speed: Underground 2 provides several new features, such as a broader customization, new methods of selecting races, the \"explore\" mode (similar to the Midnight Club series, in a large city known as \"Bayview\"). The City Center was based on Philadelphia, Beacon Hill was based on Beverly Hills and Coal Harbor was based on Camden, New Jersey, and Bayview as a whole is a microcosm of the west coast of the United States. Underground 2 also introduces several SUVs, which could be customized as extensively as other Underground 2 vehicles and used to race against other SUV racers. Brooke Burke is the voice of Rachel Teller, the person who guides the player throughout the game.\nThe game has been ported to PlayStation Portable, under the title of Need for Speed: Underground Rivals. The Nintendo DS port introduces a new feature in which the player is able to design custom decals to adorn any vehicle in the game.",

The events set in a zombie apocalypse environment. \n\n###Modes \nThere are three game modes. The first one is a classical story mode.\nYou play as a taxi driver, who is doing his work when the virus appears. You need to get to the military checkpoint, where you have to complete different missions: picking up survivors around the city, transporting something or even killing. You have to fight with the bosses – substantial mutated zombies. In the second mode, Blood Race, the player enters the brutal race. You can chase the cars and take them down. There are three distinct game types: classic race; eliminator, where the player needs to take down cars as many as he can; the endurance, in which you need to race with a ticking bomb in your vehicle. The last one is Slaughter. You try to survive on different arenas as long as you can. \n\n###Gameplay \nAs for the vehicles, there are 13 types of driving. It includes a fire truck, bulldozer, and tank.\nEvery vehicle feels different, so you can taste it and choose the most convenient one. Upgrading the vehicle on the fly is possible. The game offers the variety of weapons. You can burn zombies with flamethrowers or attack with the launcher. You fight with crowds of zombies at a time, especially in the Slaughter mode. The types of enemies can be unusual: there are zombies dogs, for instance. Medical drops, scattered around the city, can help to manage your health.",

There is an open world which is permitted to discover at any time in contrary with, for instance, Most Wanted, where the environment was zoned, and the locations opened as the story progressed.\nThe car collisions system has become more realistic compared to the previous parts of the game, but damage remained cosmetic only with no impact on performance. However, the car may be destroyed in Highway Battle — one of the game mods. \nThe title features some RPG elements — wheelman points, which grants the player access to bonus levels and car parts. \nThe police in the game are traced by the bar at the top of the screen varying between Busted and Evade modes. The capturing of the player results in the checkpoint restart.\n\n###Plot \nThe game's title suggests the protagonist role in the story — he is an undercover police agent given a task to infiltrate the group of street-racers to expose them to arrest. The background behind the races is taking down the criminal gangs and cliques. During the narrative player is faced with some dilemmas demanding a hard choice of him on which side to take.",

    "description": "Forza Horizon 3 is a racing open-world game developed by Playground Games. It is a part of a large Forza series including 11 titles in it with Horizon 3 being the 9th heading in the row. It is, however, uncertain to claim that there is a unified narrative in racing games, so all 11 titles more likely represent one universe, but do not come in specific order.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the title series does not follow a distinct storyline. Speaking of surroundings, nonetheless, it is safe to say, that the Horizon 3's scene is an Australia. The previous chapters of racing have pushed a narrative about the players being a participator of Horizon Festival. Now the protagonist becomes a host of the event, so they must play organizing roles, too. For example, hire drivers and adjust the racing grounds.\r\nThere are some events players can be a part of.  For example, drifting competition, Bucket List challenges and time trials. All of them utilize the same mechanics of getting to the finish line as fast as possible. There are more than 350 cars available, let alone DLC ones. 4-person co-op included along with multiplatform races between PC and Xbox One.",

The studio successfully raised funds for development in 2014 at Kickstarter and released the project in the same year. Only two people worked on the game: they just graduated from college and had some experience developing game mods. The game uses the Unity graphics engine and is available on Steam for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and OS X.\n\n###Game mechanics\nThere are no conditions for victory or defeat in the game. Each time players simply spawn on the playing field, where they can interact freely with game figures and pieces. All the craziness occurs within the realistic physical model, which the developers have added for greater similarity to the real prototypes. In addition to the insanity that can be arranged in multiplayer along with ten other players, the game engine supports the ability to use preset rules for different board games and thus play them.\n\n###Key features\nThere are several games included. For example, chess, poker, and checkers. The set is small, but the game supports Steam Workshop and the ability to download your own models of figures and game boards. Thus, players added to the standard set of three games three thousand more variations, most of which are variations on games, for the inclusion of which developers will have to purchase a license.",

This limit does not increase with leveling up. In order to destroy an enemy robot, the players have to damage at least 75% of their CPU. One of the main features of the game is a complex damage model that allows for damage redirection and redistribution. Players have a wide variety of weaponry in their disposal which includes several energy weapons, ballistics and all things explosive. There are multiple rarity variants for every weapon which boost one of the stats of the weapon. \n\nThe game features multiple social features as creating player's own platoons and clans.

You can build everything that comes to your mind. The second is Science. Here you can experiment and improve technology. The third is career. Here you are responsible for the smooth functioning of all departments, including administration strategies, crew management, reputation, taking up contracts to earn funds etc.\nThere are also tasks to deal somehow with asteroids, create bases and stations in space, discover new planets and search for minerals in their bowels, and so on.\nThe ship's behavior is based on the real physics of such phenomena, the ship behaves naturally in this sense, and our solutions must comply with this. Similarly, it is necessary to take into account other physical realities, such as a possible explosion of fuel due to overheating and so on.",

There’s also a multiplayer mode where you can compete with other players online.\nClicker Heroes is an idle game focused on grinding gold to upgrade your characters. There's no storyline in the game; in fact, it's an endless process of beating more and more powerful enemies, progress and get better heroes. There are microtransactions in the game; however, they don't affect your progress through the game. \nThe upgrade system is set around the in-game currency called hero souls that you can use to buy so-called Ancients that buff your stats. Hero souls drop from bosses you can beat on every fifth and tenth level. The key feature of the game is the way it uses hero souls to reset the game. Every time you want to upgrade Ancients and get more bonuses, you need to use a special ability that makes you start the game over. While you need to complete the levels and develop the heroes again, Ancients’ bonuses remain and let you progress faster.\nClicker Heroes is followed by Clicker Heroes 2 that is currently in Steam Early Access. Unlike its free-to-play predecessor, the sequel uses a buy-to-play model instead of micro-transaction",

The point of the game is to find all of the notes and progress through the plot, but collecting all the items is not necessary — it is nonetheless recommended to assemble them all to recollect the 1959 events. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game is mostly about exploring and uncovering the mystery behind the death of the hike participators. There are some jump-scares involved. The gameplay centers around walking and hiding from The Shadows of the dead students— the only hostile characters in the game. With the absence of jumping ability, the protagonist has quite a few exploring tricks at their disposal. The game is strictly linear giving, however, with the ability to replay the main plot, collecting every possible note. \n\n###Key features\nKholat is often considered to have atmospheric and immersive experience thanks to Shaun Bin voiceover and the unique soundtrack; all of the above is considered as a softening factor for the games various flaws: a bunch of invisible walls, optimization issues and no narrative as a whole.",

It is the first game in the series to feature MMO-kind of gameplay, where every players' action affects the plot of the games universe. This is the fourth installment in the Elite video games series and it's the sequel to Frontier: First Encounters. This is one of those successful Kickstarter campaigns which launched in 2012. The pre-released version of Elite Dangerous was available since December 2013 and after one long year it was finally released as a full game on Microsoft Windows. In 2015 it was released on OS X and Xbox One and one year later  - on PlayStation 4. The game also supports VR devices including HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.\nElite Dangerous is set in a year 3304. Its premise, as with the other games in the series, is to start as a small ship with a small amount of money and then with measures of trading, mining, bounty-hunting, piracy and assassination to go up your career. \nThere are three different factions in the game including Empire of Achenar, the Galactic Federation, and the Alliance of Independent Systems and four player status levels (combat, CQC Championship, exploration and trading).",

Want to see a company of WW2 U.S soldiers fight 11,000 Medieval soldiers?? There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!\nThe Technology:\nUnfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting.\nYes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!",

The wife went to another man, taking the children. On the other hand, the new prosecutor of his town, a young woman, demonstrates sympathy.\nMayor of Freeburg is exactly the one who wants to fire the hero, it was he who determined the terms of his dismissal.\nIn the city there are two mafia groups.

Luckily, the main character has a scientific background, hence why he can build any machinery from steam engines to exoskeletons, power grids, and oil plants. The planet's inhabitants start to think that they got infected by the astronaut and try to eliminate the threat as soon as possible.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls only one character that can move around the map freely by walking at first and using vehicles later into the game. The unknown planet that the players explore is rich with oil, minerals, water, and other fauna.\n\nThe player controlled character can mine the resources by himself and the tools that can be crafted or by building specific mining equipment. The latter will be much more effective. The same thing goes for resource processing and other stages of item development as from the game's beginning, the players can't keep up with all the things they have to do simultaneously.\n\nThe game features a Tower Defence aspect, as the planet's inhabitants set out to kill the player and eliminate the cause of damage to their planet.

Each machine has to be assembled before use. The player is given a variety of modules to build from, and they include all kinds of weaponry, not necessarily medieval. Using improbable combinations of wheels, drills, spikes, blades, propellers, cannons, and water hoses you can turn your death machine into a plane, a tank, a robot, or rather something not found in the real world. Each machine is built with a purpose to complete a level objective, be it to destroy an enemy castle, slaughter the opposing army, or move an object to a destination. Levels include many kinds of obstacles, such as landmines, trees, rocks, and enemy soldiers. \nThe machines can be of any shape, however grotesque or impractical. If they’re not well-thought or too shaky to withstand attacks and obstacles, they will fall apart, catch fire, or explode. However, failing spectacularly is half the fun of Besiege.",

However, instead of protecting your base from waves of enemies, in this game, you try to break into aliens' facilities. \nThe story is set in the near future when an alien spacecraft falls on Earth. As the head of an investigation team, you need to explore the anomalies happening around the parts of the ship and find out the information about the catastrophe. As the section of the spacecraft landed in several cities, game events take place around the world.  \nThe core gameplay is reversed tower defense mechanics. You have several armor units in the convoy; however, you can't manage them directly. Instead, you need to set paths for them through the city streets and use different boosts to make your attack more effective and help the convoy survive. \nAnomaly: Warzone Earth is followed by Anomaly 2 that presents several new maps and mechanics including tower defense vs. tower offense multiplayer mode.",

    "description": "In the far-distant future, far, far away in space (to be exact, a thousand light-years from the Earth), on the planet Far, Far Range, mega-corporations (they, it turns out, will be with us in the distant future!) discovered the ideal source of income, universal natural resource - Plort.\n\nYou can produce almost anything from Plot - from food and household chemicals, to solid alloys and incredibly powerful batteries.\n\nPlort is a concentrated mucus produced by slimes - jelly-like living organisms of various species and characteristics.\n\nSlimes, unfortunately, can not be taken to Earth to breed and receive the right amount of Plort. We have to fly to 'Far, Far Range', to build there something like a ranch for slimes and for all this to hire earthlings. One of these earthlings, the space rancheros, the brave young girl Beatrix LeBeau is the character of the game. The girl (and the player) will fly a thousand light-years in a deep sleep to equip a ranch from a Hobson Twillgers, study the planet's environment, collect, feed and breed slimes.\n\nTo get the necessary hints the girl can look for notes of the former owner - they meet on the territory of the ranch, and also communicate via Star Mail with a close friend from the Earth. In conversations with a friend, we learn a lot of things about the former, earthly life of the heroine - this information will be important.\n\n###Gameplay and economics\nSlimes need to be fed, and this is important. The rest they will do themselves.\nIt is necessary to feed them not by anything, but by appropriate products. But slimes will produce a lot of Plort - and Plort can be sold on the market, having received currency - newbucks. For newbucks you can buy equipment for ranches and so on. The world of the game is not known until the end, it is possible and necessary to travel through it, opening up new locations, finding new slimes for the ranch, as well as food for slimes and other new resources.\n\nFrom different types of slimes you can get hybrids. However, with this you need to be more careful - you can get aggressive evil slimes, which will have to be dissolved with water.\n\nSlimes are quite diverse. Ordinary slimes are generally friendly, but they can be dangerous not because of evil will, but because of some natural features like thorns, emitted radiation or the ability to explode.\n\nSome slimes are more productive than others, they produce more Plort. It is these slimes that are created by hybridization, since it is difficult to find them in a natural environment.\n\nOrdinary slimes sometimes merge into a huge Gordo-slime - inside such organisms there are often valuable resources and other interesting and useful things. To get all this, you need to blow up the Gordo-slime.\n\n###Game modes\nAdventure. The world is open for research, there are no serious restrictions. You can develop as you want. You can communicate with other ranchers, carry out their assignments and exchange resources with them. \n\nCarefree is an adventure mode that goes even easier.\n\nThe five-day trial is a mode in which you need to earn as many newbucks as possible in 5 days.\n\n\"The steel master of the ranch\" - the conditions in this mode are so complicated that it resembles a game of survival. In the mode there are unique tests that change the impression of the game.",

He wanted to create a game which focuses on story. He decided to use live action footage and created a police procedural game. In order to make it as much realistic as possible, Barlow watched lots of real police interviews, by doing so he discovered that there is a lot of ambiguity in those files and he wanted to incorporate that into the game as well.  \r\nThe game was praised because of its original narrative, character performance and interesting gameplay mechanics.",

Each character has different skills and special abilities, so the squad should be appropriately chosen in advance. From the very beginning, players are able to assume the roles of four criminals: the Locksmith, the Cleaner, the Lookout, and the Pickpocket. The remaining four – the Mole, the Gentleman, the Redhead, and the Hacker – will be unlocked during the further game progress. The gameplay is about completing levels in multiple ways depending on the players’ character choice. Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine gives an opportunity to dive into the crime world and participate in heists and robberies throughout the world alone or in co-operation up to four players.",

It is also a strategy set in space with the science-fiction lore.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe point of the game is to conquer as many planets as possible using the given resources. The protagonist can be chosen out of three races: industrials, aliens and psychics each with unique special abilities.\nThe gameplay process occurs exclusively in online mode, but single battles and succeeds against enemy AI is possible too. However, the campaign as a whole cannot be played offline. \n\n###Key features\nAs in usual RTS, the gameplay is centered around resource management — the title's economy consists of prices on Metal, Credits, and Crystal — each with the individual gain conditions. So it would be impossible for instance to sell all of your metal to the friendly guild — after the wholesale, stock prices decrease and economy shifts towards them like real-life one.\nWhile exploring the world, the player may stumble across habitable planets and anomalies which prevent the player from getting to the goal. Anomalies include asteroids, hostile environment, and ice fields.\n\n###Rebellion DLC\nThe expansion adds two new units into the gams: Loyalist and Rebel — delegates of any races can choose between them. A graphical engine was updated as well.",

    "description": "Satellite Reign is a real-time strategy, where you customize your team of four members and fight the tyranny of a mega-corporation called Dracogenics. The game is set in the open-world cyberpunk future, so the visuals combine dark locations with neon-highlighted spots. The gameplay depends on your soldiers’ class. You can use agents with different abilities to form a group that suits your playstyle. There are multiple ways to complete missions, whether you prefer to be stealthy or rush through enemies’ facilities.\nThe story takes place in a fictional City, where Dracogenics gets the full control over politics and military forces. To release the city, you become the head of a rival corporation and set attacks against Dracogenics. The goal is to overcome the evil syndicate using well-designed tactics.\nExcept for missions, the game pays attention to the technology development and resource management you need to provide to defeat Dracogenics. Meanwhile, the interaction between your corporation and civilians is minimal, so you don’t need to affect their attitude to you to win.",

In Dragonfall, you control a team of shadowrunners, led by your protagonist, in an isometric view. While hacking a data vault in Berlin, your party discovers dangerous secrets that were better left unknown. The characters in your team are highly developed, have backstories and inspire sympathy. To avoid losing your favorite companion, you will have to plan your battles prudently.\nDragonfall was originally a DLC released to support the previous part, Shadowrun Returns.

    "description": "New York, Manhattan Peninsula (very detailed), our days. The townspeople are struck by a mutation that turns people into bloodthirsty monsters.\n\nThe protagonist of the game is a seemingly unremarkable young man named Alex Mercer. At the beginning of the game, we know little about him, but it's still more than he knows about himself - Alex does not remember anything, does not even know that he has super abilities.\n\nAbilities are very useful to him, because he will have to stop the epidemic and at the same time hide from the army, police and mercenaries.\n\n###Plot\nAlex comes to the senses in Ghentec's morgue, located in its Manhattan headquarters. Apparently, the reason for his awakening was the noise produced by mercenaries of the organization Blackwatch, trying to break open the doors of this headquarters.\n\nAlex tries to hide, run away. The mercenaries try to stop him, but Alex discovers in himself one by one amazing abilities - he is not harmed by bullets, he can jump high, throw heavy objects, run on the walls of buildings. And he can \"absorb\" people, taking their appearance and gaining knowledge about everything that the absorbed people know and remember. For example, after the takeover of one of the commanders of Blackwatch, Alex finds out that he has a sister.\n\nAlex finds his sister and learns from her (this time without absorption) that he was an important employee of the company, at the headquarters of which we met him at the beginning of the game. Alex's job duties included working with biological weapons.\n\nDuring the game, the army and the police consider Alex guilty of creating and spreading the virus, Blackwatch pursues Alex for other reasons, and Alex himself tries to stop the mutants and other opponents with all the power of their super abilities. Soon it turns out that among these superpowers there is the ability to turn his body into almost anything, including weapons, shield and armor.\n\n###Gameplay\n\nAll of Manhattan from the very beginning of the game is open for the game. Outside of Manhattan, however, you can not get out. The player can follow the story, and can perform separate missions. Due to the presence of super abilities, the hero can move both horizontally and on walls. But not as an insect, but just running. Falling from the height does not hurt Alex, so he can use this trick to defeat opponents - literally falling on their heads.\n  \nAlex can jump very high, and manage to plan in the air.\n\nAlex fights, using the ability of his body to transform. His hands can turn into sledgehammers, blades, whips or shields. He can instantly increase the volume of his body's muscles to increase their strength - in normal mode, such a mass would have prevented him, so he does not wear all these muscles all the time. His skin can be turned into armor. He can also see in the dark and distinguish mutants from normal people by eyes.\n\nAll abilities can also be improved as you progress in the game and perform various tasks.\n\nIn addition to the super powers of the body, the hero uses assault rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, captures infantry combat vehicles, tanks, helicopters and uses their weapons.",

    "description": "This is a casual tower defense game from the PopCap Games studio. The main characters are homeowners who, with the help of plants, protect their garden from the invasion of zombies. The game was ported to all kinds of consoles, including mobile platforms.\n\nIn Plants vs. Zombies player places on the playing field of tower-plants, which automatically bombard attacking zombies. The main goal is not to let the undead get to the house. The towers are distinguished by their effectiveness against a certain type of enemies and the attack modes. \n\nThe game has several modes: in addition to the usual singleplayer campaign, Adventure Mode is available where a player can earn currency for in-game upgrades. The battle layout also changes throughout the game: it starts on a simple backyard and advances into more complicated night levels and etc.\n\nThe game has a lot of references to the works of popular culture: for example, inscriptions on tombstones are taken from Monty Python's  \"Dead Parrot sketch\".",

Once between people and Varls was hostility, but with the emergence of dredges, they were forced to unite forces, for not being killed by them. At the beginning of the game in the world reigns eternal winter; the gods left all races, and the sun stopped, it would seem, forever.\r\n\r\nThe story begins with Ubin, who arrived in the port city Strand for an annual tribute. Upon arrival in the town, he learns that some bandits want to capture the authority. He's moving to the Town Tall to help the Governor deal with them. Soon, a squad of Prince Vognir and Prince Ludin arrive in the Strand. In the next morning, Ubin joins the team of Vognir, and they are all going in Grofheim\r\n\r\nThe player controls a squad of soldiers under the leadership of the hero. In a single-player game, the hero has a story task, which usually requires getting to some point of the game world. On the way to the target, you can occur all sorts of events, and some of them will need the player to make decisions that affect future events.",

The game takes place in the well-known Fallout universe yet it does not continue the story of any other Fallout games released previously. For those who pre-ordered this game, a special bonus CD was delivered. It includes bonus mission for the main game and a table top game in the Fallout universe. \nFallout Tactics is a game about tactical combat and strategy and this time players have much more limited interaction with NPC characters yet they can still trade with them. The game centers around bunkers of Brotherhood from where the player has to go to missions after preparing for them by obtaining the services of quartermasters, mechanics, personal yeomen and medics. \nIn Fallout Tactics, missions take place in towns or factories, military camps or a Vault. In missions, the player gets a map with marked objectives and notes. Fallout Tactics offers a deep combat mechanic, which features three different modes of combat: Continuous Turn-Based, Individual Turn-Based and Squad Turn-Based combat types.",

There are many diffident activities for players ranging from quiet trading, mining, and manufacturing to full-on real-time space battles that can last for many hours and include hundreds of players.  \nOne of the game’s main features is freedom of player interaction. Many aspects of the game such as economics can be described as player-driven. Players can form corporations and alliances that can conquer some of the game’s 7800+ star systems. This leads to a lot of unique and unscripted situations affecting in-game politics and economics. Another notable part of the game is that real-world money can be used to buy different items that sometimes can cost hundreds of dollars.",

Scribe any word in it, and it becomes real (of course, only if the word you wrote describes a particular object). The game will understand your written words and create interactive in-game objects. They are used to solve puzzles, which earns you Starites, the ultimate goal of the game. The ability to summon any imaginable item gives you an almost unlimited number of ways you can solve any puzzle.\nScribblenauts Unlimited features a way more detailed plot than its predecessors. There's an extensive backstory that explains the protagonist's motivation in gathering Starites. We learn that Max and his sister Lily played pranks on people using their magic notebook until it got them into trouble. One day they unknowingly played a trick against an old wizard. He grew angry and magically turned Lily into stone. Max can only save his sister by gathering enough Starites. Unlike previous parts, this game is set in an open, albeit cartoonish, world, that gradually opens to you as you gather more Starites. The tasks are now assigned by the NPCs, and Starites are given as a reward for help. Thus, they serve as the proof that Max has corrected his behavior.",

    "description": "Dying Light is a first-person action horror game with the elements of survival. It is a first part of the Dying light series followed by Dying Light 2. The game is set in the open-world environment of fictional Harran city. Players are offered to assume the role of an undercover agent Kyle Crane who has been sent in the quarantine zone. His mission is to find the rogue politician Kadir \"Rais\" Suleiman lost somewhere in the infected giant city. On the way to achieving the goal, Kyle will meet other survivors, who desperately try to stay alive among zombies. The chief game mechanic is running the generators and turning on streetlights throughout Harran to make another part of the map accessible and safe at nighttime. The game features day/night time cycles that change the game remarkably: the action becomes fast-paced, and all the infected people turn into dangerous zombies. Therefore, the gameplay is based on armed combat against mutants and Kyle’s sneak and parkour skill for preventing it.",

And they fell into seven deadly sins, one for each.\nThe hero uses the old destroyed tower as a base. He brings there all the trophies and gradually transforms it into a comfortable, spacious and in every respect well-equipped room. Among the trophies are artefacts stolen from the tower, which add even new places to the tower, increase the health and magical power of Overlord.\nMinions are of four kinds, each species has its own abilities. Minions perish in battle, but Overlord can summon new ones from special wells, paying for it with the life force of dead enemies. You can build a smithy and then buy and improve weapons there.\nOverlord can behave differently, he is tempted by the same sins that enslaved his opponents. Its \"corruption\" exists in the game as one of its parameters, measured, displayed and affects the course and end of the game.",

Rufus dreams of moving to Elysium - a planet where life is entirely different.\nHe calls himself an inventor, but his ability to invent is very doubtful, like his successes in life in general. He lives in the home of his ex-girlfriend and does not do anything useful. Nevertheless, one day he manages to get on the ship of the organisation \"Organnon\", to get on Elysium. He meets on this ship a girl from Elysium, but when trying to protect her in a conflict with the owners of the ship accidentally pushes her off the ship. The girl flies down and falls on Deponia. Then the intrigue begins, the locals build their plans for the girl, and Rufus returns to Deponia and, as it turns out, has romantic feelings for the girl (and still wants to get to Elysium). In all this takes part the mayor of the city and many other residents, as well as robots. The girl herself lost her memory of the fall, and the members of the Organnon have an intention to blow up Deponia.",

During the game, he must reveal his purpose and find a way to solve the problem of \"Hollowborn\" children.\n\nYou will need to travel around the world of Eora, performing tasks for different groups, the relationship with each of which determines a specific reputation system. Reputation is calculated separately for each group and depends on the actions of the player. Fights with opponents occur in real time with the ability to stop the time. Up to five characters-companions can accompany the hero, they not only help in combat but also reveal some important details of the plot.\n\nThis game uses a unique role-playing system. A prominent place in it is given to the skills and abilities of the character, not related to the battles. The feature of this system is that the combat and non-combat skills of the character develop independently.",

The emperor was recently killed along with his sons, except one that was hidden far from the capital. Before he died, the emperor gave his Amulet of Kings to the protagonist, a prisoner whom the emperor believed to be a future hero he saw in dreams. \r\nThe main character is fully customizable. His or her character class race, gender, age and other attributes are chosen by the player. His quest is to escape prison and find the royal heir. However, since the game is open-world, the player may abandon the central storyline and just wander around Tamriel. You can complete a variety of side quests, join various guilds and factions, or just fight monsters to gain experience. There's an option of \"fast travel\" that allows you to instantly move to an already discovered location.\r\nGame of the Year Edition also contains two expansion packs: Shivering Isles and the Knights of the Nine that expand the game’s storyline. The packs introduce several new locations, two additional factions (the Court of Madness and Knights of the Nine), and a number of new armor, weapons and other items.",

You will explore the forbidden area around Chernobyl, Ukraine, after a new disaster that turned into The Zone, a post-apocalyptic wasteland full of mutants. The setting was inspired by a Russian sci-fi book Roadside Picnic and its adaptation Stalker. Scar, the main character of Clear Sky, is a stalker, which in this world is a term for guides and explorers in The Zone. He was hit by an energy beam that gave him a superhuman ability to survive The Zone’s phenomena. Scar joins the Clear Sky, a secret science organization that studies The Zone’s anomalies. Strelok, an important character from the previous game, appears as the main antagonist. \nLike its predecessor, Clear Sky is a combination of first-person shooter gameplay with RPG mechanics like skills, leveling up, dialogue, and inventory. The player is free to explore the open world and accept quests unrelated to the central plot from various NPCs and factions. Compared to Shadow of Chernobyl, the prequel has improved graphics, additional options for customization and equipment repair and a complete day/night cycle.",

Once the protagonist Vella finds herself chosen to be the sacrificed maiden. As she tries to stay alive, she realizes that the only way out is to fight the monster and to liberate her hometown. The second story tells about Shay, a lone boy imprisoned in a spaceship between two AI systems. The boy seeks independence and starts to explore the entire ship then moving to the whole war-torn galaxy. Both storylines are not expected to connect somehow, but in the course of completion game levels, players start to notice similar slight details.",

However, the scavenger by mistake sucks the cleaner Joseph (you play as him). And the bandit washes off, kidnaping Joseph's girlfriend, Berta. From this moment the game begins. \n\nThe most significant difference from other games made in this genre is that the interaction occurs only with those objects that the protagonist can reach.

    "description": "Valiant Hearts is a sidescroller adventure with a significant amount of attention paid to artwork and historical authenticity. While being not so demanding on a software side, it was released on the mobile platforms as well as on the big consoles. Such variety of platforms, however, limits the gameplay peculiarities that can be featured within a game. \nThe player takes a role of one of four characters on the Belgian, American, French and German side of the Great War conflict — World War I. During the game they need to solve puzzles, watch animated cutscenes, fight enemies and do military races. \nValiant Hearts is thus telling four stories simultaneously and ties them up in the end and throughout a fabula, while being historically correct when it is crucial. The game has received the Best Narrative awards and the Games for Change awards for such a plot-twists.",

The game follows a female astronaut stranded on the abandoned space research station in a science-fictional universe. Completing the game players will be able to learn more about the fate of researches and to restore the sequence of events held aboard the station. Players assume the role of the protagonist, as she tries to clarify the mystery of a unique item, which allows her to clone herself and to transfer the mind to the clone. Therefore, the cloning ability is a basic game mechanic that helps the player to solve puzzles and complete levels. The gameplay features traditional side-scrolling platformers’ elements: players control the 2D action from the third-person perspective. In the course of the completion, players are going to face obstacles of varying degrees of complexity ranging from simple barriers (however inaccessible for clones) to higher platforms or even gravity shutdowns.",

But the yarn that Yarni is made of is subject to him, he can catch on to the object, pull himself up and climb up, swing and jump, maybe even pull yarn and walk along it like a tightrope walker. The variety of these techniques is large enough, tips help to use them. You can interact with all objects, sometimes there are creatures that can block the path - for example, insects.\nYarn can not be unrolled indefinitely, it is necessary to monitor its consumption. Sometimes you can return the unwound yarn back to the \"body\", sometimes you can increase the amount of yarn, finding a new piece.\nThe most valuable thing Yarni finds is memories. Memories of a family of people, from which he \"comes\" himself. Memories are painted with different emotions, a sufficient number of collected memories opens the entrance to the following levels. In the game there are two lines of events. Events of the past arise as memories, they are found by Yarni. At the same time, the Yarni journey goes in the present - and also serves as a source of events that make up not the past but the present.",

    "description": "You control a nameless and faceless protagonist, who starts in a white chamber in the center of a high-tech maze. Your goal is to move forward through the maze by solving many difficult and intricate puzzles. Antichamber reminds Portal game series and Cube films to some extent, but with more emphasis on puzzle solving, sketchy graphics, and very little plot. Unlike in Portal or Cube, the protagonist cannot die, even if the player fails. There are no traps, and the only penalty for failure is that you have to try again. The protagonist is armed with a variety of “guns”, each of them allows you to manipulate a certain set of objects in the maze. \nAntichamber is defined by its impossible, non-euclidian geometry that bends 3D space in the ways not found in the real world. All the regular laws of physic do not apply in this place that seems to be straight out of M. C. Escher's drawings. Doors can become portals leading to an unpredictable place, or even different places, depending on how you enter them. The visual style of Antichamber is very minimalistic. Walls, doors, and ladders are only outlined with sketch-like black contours, while any color serves to attract the player's attention to a certain object. Everything else is blank white, which makes for a cold, neat atmosphere of a math exercise.",

    "title": "Catherine",
    "description": "Catherine is a platformer/visual novel developed by Atlus for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011.\r\n\r\n###Plot\r\nThe plot follows the adventures of Vincent Brooks, who is choosing between the two girlfriends — Katerine and Catherine with the opposite personalities. While making relationship choices throughout the daytime, Vinet is forced to participate in realistic nightmares at night. The setting of a title is two narratives folded one into another: on the outer layer, the game has TV-Show \"The Midnight Versus\" which tells the story of an inner layer — the adventures of \"Catherine\" world.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe gaming process consists of two stages, according to the protagonist's activities. While the ventures during the day resemble the usual visual novel mechanics: walking, listening to dialogues and watching cinematics pieces, the action gameplay reveals itself in the night. There Vincent has to climb a set of stairs by removing and climbing blocks to avoid traps. If he fails — the protagonist dies in real life.\r\n\r\n###Reception\r\nThe game journalists generally liked the game but were disappointed by the sexists and misogynistic stories found within it. The title obtained commercial success, and thus there is a remaster coming out for PS4 and Vita. The remaster was half-ready in late 2017.",

But now one brave clone learned his real purpose and is going to escape to freedom. \nGameplay in Stealth Inc. 2 is centered around stealth action, for which the game was even compared to the Splinter Cell series despite huge stylistic differences. The clone has to move swiftly and silently to avoid security cameras and sentry robots. Its time is limited, however, and the player has to find the balance between speed and safety. Level design in Stealth Inc. 2 reminds of Metroidvania-style platformers. The factory is split into areas, consisting of eight test chambers each, all of them interconnected in the manner called overworld. The player will have to solve puzzles to open new areas. Every area introduces a gadget that should be equipped and is essential to use to move forward. Some of the puzzles are deadly traps that are only solved through trial and error. On the first walkthrough, they will almost inevitably kill the clone and send it back to the checkpoint.",

    "description": "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a game about defusing a bomb. It was initially made for virtual reality headsets but also supports traditional screens and controls.\n\n###Player cooperation\nThe game is meant to be played by at least two people in cooperation. Only one of them is wearing the VR headset or actually interacts with the computer. He or she acts as the main defuser who has to deactivate the bomb. All other players assume the roles of the experts. Their task is to help the defuser by reading aloud a manual about bombs. The experts need to be either in the same room with the defuser or to contact him or her over an audio messenger. \n\nThe defuser is the only player who can see the bomb. He or she has to describe it in details to other players. The experts, in turn, have to find the described blocks in their manuals and tell the defuser what to do to solve the puzzle. \n\n###Bombs as puzzles\nThe composition and other attributes of each bomb are randomly generated for each level, and the players can customize them. The bombs consist of individual blocks, which are puzzles on their own. Some of the blocks require regular attention from the defuser, while others can be disarmed once and for all. \n\nThe time for each level is limited. When the countdown reaches the end, the bomb will explode. Defuser's errors may also speed up the countdown or even activate the bomb and \"kill\" him or her. Each bomb has its own limit of time and errors.",

The game bears some resemblance to Tetris with the difference being the objective to stack the blocks instead of clearing rows of them. The rows do not disappear. The game is physics-based, so the player can't win by just dropping the blocks in a random manner. Several in-game events are present, for example, the blocks may drop faster or become slippery. Sometimes the blocks even double in size. You play as a wizard that competes against other wizards and has to build his tower as tall and stable as possible. \n\nIt is possible to cast spells that either assist the players or make the building harder for other wizzards. The players can use 17 spells Throughout a match. Light magic spells are used for making the gameplay easier for the player while Dark magic spells make it harder for your opponents to progress. \n\nThree game modes are present: Race, Puzzle, and Survival. A handful of single-player challenges is also available where the player has to meet certain game conditions to succeed.",

    "description": "Skullgirls is a fighting game developed by Lab Zero and primarily published by Marvelous and Autumn Games. Since its initial release in 2012, it has received two free extensions, Skullgirls Encore and Skullgirls 2nd Encore and while its roster initially consisted of an all-female cast of 8 characters, 6 more characters were added, 5 being developed thanks to the game's Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, including 2 male characters. At its release, Skullgirls was developed by Reverge Labs, but the team that created the game split off from the company to form Lab Zero. In Japan, the game is published by Arc System Works. On Nintendo Switch, the game is published by Skybound Games.\n\nSkullgirls takes place in the Canopy Kingdom, inspired by 1940s America, in which corruption and conflict runs rampant. Once every seven years, an artifact called the Skull Heart appears, granting the wish of one woman. However, if the Skull Heart is used by a woman with impure intentions, it will control her, turning her into a destructive monster called the Skullgirl. Not once has anyone used the Skull Heart without falling to its curse. The game follows the stories of 14 characters on their way to face the Skullgirl and retrieve the Heart, be it for the greater good or simply their own gain.\n\nThe game is a tribute to Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and its mechanics are intended as a more polished version of the classic fighting game title, with some original ideas. In a standard player vs. player match, each player controls one character out a chosen number of one to three characters which they can switch to at any time. They can also call their inactive characters to perform assist attacks. Like most Marvel vs. Capcom-inspired games, Skullgirls is fast-paced and features long, complex combos based on animation cancels. It introduces a burst system which allows players to break their opponent's combo if it becomes too long.\n\nSkullgirls features a 'dark deco'-inspired art style mixed with some horror themes and a jazz and rock soundtrack consisting of 28 tracks. In 2013, the game set the Guinness World Record Gamer's Edition record for most average frames of animation per character in a video game, reaching 1,439 frames per character and 11,515 frames total for its initial eight-character roster.\n\nIn February 2013, Skullgirls came in second in a crowdfunding event organized by fighting game website Shoryuken to decide what would be the final game featured on the EVO 2013 line up, with all proceeds sent to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Skullgirls raised over $US 78,000. While it was not featured as an EVO main game, EVO organizers supported the game's side event by providing prize money and advertisement.",

Initially released for arcade platform, the game shares gameplay mechanics with its predecessors, where the player takes control of a squad of four soldiers and faces continuous waves of enemies throughout each level.\nThe game’s plot follows the previous events, where the main characters succeeded in overthrowing a maniac and bringing relative peace. This time, however, it is revealed that our heroes' nemesis is back for more, with new allies and new soldiers to try and stop the protagonists. As the levels progress, the player faces different enemies, each with unique patterns and abilities, and also finds new weapons and upgrades for his character of choice. Another feature of the series is its vehicles, including tanks, planes, helicopters and even a spaceship. Each of those can be used to the various extent and provide significant bonuses to character’s firepower, defense, or movement capabilities.\nThe game is made using pixel graphics, and even though it was initially released in 2000, the sceneries and the details are still as stunning. Each character’s looks are refined, explosions are made colorful and as realistic for a 2D game as possible, and the locations themselves would look like art.",

    "description": "Soulcalibur VI is the seventh major installment in its series of 3D sword fighting games. This installment serves as a reboot of the Soulcalibur series.\n\n###Plot\nThe plot retells the events that happened before and during the original Soulcalibur and alters them, thus creating a new timeline for the franchise. The events of the game are set between 1583 and 1590. As with the original, the story is based around the conflict between two magical swords, the evil Soul Edge that devours souls and Soul Calibur, the spiritual sword, and their respective wielders. The Soul Edge belonged to a dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon until a brave knight named Siegfried challenged him.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game is meant to attract new players to the series, and some of the changes were made for that goal. For example, the game introduces Reversal Edge mechanic, in which two opponents enter a slow-mo scene and exchange blows in a rock-paper-scissors manner by pushing a single button. This option allows even the novice players to counter most types of attacks. There's also a new Lethal Hit mechanic which allows the players to knock the opponent down by performing moves in the right time.\n\n###Characters\nThe game includes most of the popular characters of the series, such as Mitsurugi, Siegfried, Sophitia, and Cervantes de Leon. Some of the characters are redesigned. Geralt, the famous protagonist of The Witcher series, appears as a playable guest character.",

    "description": "The genre of this game is defined as stealth-action. However, its plot is very unusual, although it does not contradict such a definition of the genre.\n\n###Plot\nYour character is a person who is deadly tired of a very common problem: the neighbors who threw a noisy party, not taking into account that they do not live alone in the world.\n\nIn ordinary life, you usually silently endure or call the police. But in this game you should just kill everyone who has the imprudence to make noise. You can do it with a knife, and you can use other, very simple, improvised means. At first, you only have a knife, but over time, the tools appear more interesting.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game has ten unique levels. Some details of each level are generated randomly, so each game is somewhat different from the other.\n\nAfter loading the level of the hero finds himself standing in front of a building or a complex of buildings, where there is a party with the participation of about fifty people.\n\nIt is assumed that by this time your character is already quite angry. And now he faces only one simple task - to destroy all.\n\nThe character has the skills to work with a knife, can set a variety of different traps, use various items.\n\nThere are also obstacles in the game. For example, party members may call the police, there are guards in the building, and if you kill a police officer, FBI agents will arrive. There are also others who may suddenly appear.\n\n###Bonuses\nYour character is not always the same person. There are several characters in the game that you can become as you play. These characters are more capable of killing, among them there are ninja and even a policeman.\n\nYou may have allies, someone you can call for help.\n\nThere is also a spin-off simulation game titled Party Hard Tycoon.",

It is an arcade version of the vanilla Street Fighter IV with minor changes.\n\n###Setting\nUltra Street Fighter IV takes place several months after the events of Street Fighter II and is a prequel to Street Fighter III. After the return of Bison, who was presumed to be killed in the last tournament, a weapon corporation named S.I.N announces a new event to gather all the world's mightiest fighters for the creation of a powerful weapon of mass destruction. \n\n###Gameplay\nAll in all, SF IV is a two-dimensional fighting game with post-processed cell-shaded graphics, resembling the art style of Japanese comics.\n\nThe game features the classic six-button control scheme with several additions that were made to refresh the gameplay. The combat system inherits the principles, that were introduced in SF III, such as the enhanced special attacks. Special button combos were added to implement fast movement inside an arena. \n\nThere are two energy bars in the game, one of which is used for Super Combos, special attacks called EX Special Moves, and Focus Cancels. The other one is called the Revenge Gauge and is used for executing ultra-combos.\n\n###Ultra Edition features\nThe Ultra Street Fighter was initially released on Japanese arcade machines but was later made available to the general public. Apart from the standard balancing changes and updated combat system, it features new characters and arenas.",

Thus, he has to move across Seattle to reach his final destination. On his way, Randall, in control of players, should avoid both zombies and members of self-proclaimed local authority gang called New Law. The game is made in a cinematic manner to transfer the zombie apocalypse atmosphere correctly. The gameplay is divided into levels and consists of walking through platforms and solving puzzles. Players can use Randall’s ability to entrap zombies by luring them into environmental hazards, and other mechanics of running, creeping and climbing obstacles to bypass enemies. Although the protagonist has many hostiles, combat is unavoidable in only a few situations. However, the game features some melee weapons with extremely limited ammunition, so the fight is going to be tough.",

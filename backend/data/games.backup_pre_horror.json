    "description": "A Story About My Uncle is a first-person adventure with a heavy focus on moving using a grappling hook and a non-violent approach thus making the plot and landscapes the critical focus of the gaming experience. There is no series of this game: it is the only title in the IP by Gone North also known as Goat Simulator creators. \nThe core gameplay features are the energetic costume giving its owner the ability to jump higher and use the grappling hook, and various updates to this outfit, for example, jetpack boots. While mastering this Spider-Man-like potential, the hero encounters various non-hostile NPCs and environment, the only menacing obstacle in the game is a one-eyed worm, lurking in one of the caves. However, the worst scenario is that it blows you off the cliff. Worm likes to take a nap so getting over him is not a big deal.\nThe plot follows a boy looking for his uncle, Freud. His nephew, after a little research in his flat, has discovered the super costume and traveled to another dimension. There are some optional collectibles scattered across the world. We shall also meet Maddy, who helps us find a missing character",

The available options are either to play the game on one device using split-screen or using the online multiplayer. You do not need to buy two games to play with somebody: when buying a friend, you can give the code for downloading a full version of the game, which, however, will be active only if you pass it together.\r\n\r\nThe story tells of two prisoners who were together in one prison in the US at the beginning of the 70s. To avoid the dangers of prison, they decide to flee. A Way Out is a third-person adventure game in which the story is told simultaneously for two characters. Since they develop asynchronously, there are often situations where one of the players loses the control over the character because of the story cutscene, and the other can safely move around the prison. Roles are not fixed and can change during the playthrough.",

The protagonist is a female diver, wakes up alone drifting on the ocean surface.\n\nThe main gameplay is aimed at exploring the surrounding world: the main character finds the ruins and traces of an ancient civilization that existed in symbiosis with the world's ocean. The outside world reacts to the player's actions and changes under his/her influence. However, it will not only be necessary to explore the underwater world: ground fragments also come into play in the game. Despite the simplicity and serenity of the game, there are dangers in the form of sea predators.\n\nThe story is told without a single word and the silence only helps to create a unique atmosphere of peace and tranquillity that reigns in the world of the game. The mosaic of the game setting is completed by the implementation of the game camera and the opportunity to look at the world through the eyes of fish - you need to enter the meditation mode for this.",

    "description": "As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!\nDinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!\nYou must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!\nBy chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\nPick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!\nBy bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.\nCreate a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!\nAll items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \"Engrams\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \"Explorer Notes\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!\nEverything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!\nThe mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.\nOn the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.\nYou can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!\nThe over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

    "description": "Welcome to ARK: Survival of the Fittest, the first ever M.O.S.A. - a Multiplayer Online Survival Arena - that Studio Wildcard designed for the burgeoning wild west of eSports. A spin-off from the most popular open-world Early Access game on Steam ARK: Survival Evolved, ARK: Survival of the Fittest (SotF) pits up to 72 combatants in an action-packed struggle for survival where players are ultimately pushed into an epic final showdown where only one “Tribe” will make it out alive.\n\nSurvivors can form one- to six-person Tribes with the options to choose Unofficial and Official (Ranked) servers, and a variety of game-lengths and sizes in which to play. Players will start in the base forest environment introduced in the original ARK: Survival Evolved, with new environments and creatures introduced as the game evolves. Dedicated eSport ranking, matchmaking, reward, and tournament features make ARK: SotF readily accessible to all players.\n\nBalanced for intense competition, contestants begin in a neutral staging area where they can communicate pre-game, strategize, or talk trash. After a count-down, they dramatically descend from the sky onto the ARK in a circular formation via beams of light. There is a cache of valuable items in the center – do survivors dash for the goods and fight it out, do they run into the forest and hide, search for Dinosaurs to rapidly build their army, or do they freeze up from the sheer terror of death?

    "description": "In the ruins of the fallen Adal Empire, you awaken with a mysterious mask on your face, and faint recollections of an esoteric ceremony. Freeing you from hunger, thirst, and even death, the mask is the creation of the Guides, the rulers of these lands, who have placed you here to determine whether you are worthy of becoming part of the elite corps of Absolvers. As you wander these forsaken lands, encountering other Prospects like you, you will learn new combat styles, acquire weapons, gear and armor, and build a team of warriors with whom to fight side by side in Arenas of combat.\nPlease visit the official Absolver FAQ on the Steam discussion board for more information: http://steamcommunity.com/app/473690/discussions/0/2579854400733819593/\nFluid Real-Time Combat: Position yourself in one of four tactical stances during real-time battles and execute devastating attacks, dodges, and parries. Movement becomes your weapon as you engage in solo duels or intense multiplayer melee battles.\nCustomizable Style and Flow: Players will define their character’s playstyle by picking a combat style, a weapon of choice, and arranging attacks in their Combat Deck to design their unique and personal attack flow.\nOnline Multiplayer Action and Narrative: Prospects and Absolvers will seamlessly encounter others in the world, generating unique stories that emerge through player interaction and choices. These moments are filled with tension as intentions to battle or befriend are never clear: trust is always a leap of faith. Encounters will have lasting consequences and transform into meaningful relationships as you make friends or enemies and find mentors or disciples.\nPvP and PvE: Explore a rich and dynamic world including dedicated PvP battle arenas where champions will receive spoils of victory and progress in the ranks of the Absolvers, and PvE areas in which players cooperatively battle to retrieve rare loot and equipment from the ruins of Adal.\nABSOLVER CONTENT UPDATES\nThe development team at Sloclap is dedicated to improving and expanding Absolver based on community feedback once the game is live. In the coming weeks and months, Prospects can expect regular updates to the game to fix any issues that appear, as well as both minor and major content updates. These updates already include 3v3 Game Mode and a Spectator Mode soon after launch, but many more updates can be expected, from new combat styles and moves to new powers and equipment. Please follow updates here and on absolver.com or @Absolver on Twitter for the latest.",

Action-adventure with horror elements, Alan Wake is paced like a thriller show, cinematic and slow, which is in alignment with the visual style of the rural region of Washington and linear storytelling. The main enemy, encountered by the players will be Taken – possessed by darkness creatures and humans that cannot be attacked outright, because they are shrouded in black smoke, blocking the attacks. Only after dispelling the darkness with a source of light players are able to affect the enemies. When the enemies are getting too close, Alan can perform a slow-motion dodge.\r\nTwo more episodes were published for the first game, called “The Signal” and “The Writer”, directly continuing the story of the main game, and completing the first season.",

However, it is not a full-fledged sequel to the game but rather a spin-off. The game’s tone and style are much more light-hearted and comedic than in the original, and the color palette is significantly brighter. \nThe game’s story takes place two years after the original game in a fictional town Night Springs, Arizona. The series protagonist, Alan Wake, must defeat his dark doppelganger, Mr. Scratch to escape the Dark Place. American Nightmare’s gameplay is very similar to that of the original game; however, this time it is much more action-oriented, rather than story-driven. Its combat is centered around the same chief combat mechanic – focusing the flashlight on enemies on making them vulnerable to weapon.",

    "description": "Alien: Isolation is an action-survival horror game played from the first-person perspective for a more intense experience. The game is not a sequel to any of Alien games, but it is directly connected to the original 1979 Alien film, so the gameplay includes historical references, and the game itself transfers the unique atmosphere and the old vision of the future. The action is set 15 years after the film events. Young Amanda Ripley accompanied by Nina Taylor and the android Christopher Samuels reaches a distant space station Sevastopol to investigate the case of her mother Ellen Ripley (the protagonist of the 1979 film) disappearance. On the way to the Nostromo’s (Ellen’s spacecraft) flight recorder, Amanda will face plenty of hardships like hostile androids and Aliens because the Sevastopol station is wholly abandoned. Players have to explore the entire station inhabited with Aliens. Due to the crafting system, players can create the necessary gear to prevent contacts with countless enemies.",

The gameplay is most parts identical to that of previous game and consist of exploring surroundings, solving puzzles, and avoiding monsters. Like in the previous game, your character is practically unable to confront monsters and has to hide from them to survive. However, there is no more sanity meter, and inventory in Machine for Pigs and puzzles are more physics-based than in The Dark Descent. \nIn Machine for Pigs, you play as Oswald Mandus, a first game protagonist’s descendant, and successful industrialist. He recovers after a fever which lasted for a few months after a disastrous expedition in Mexico. Not remembering anything about it, later he finds out that he build a mysterious machine in the basement of his mansion and his house is full of swine-like monsters. The player must restore Oswald’s lost memories and reveal the secret of the machine.",

    "description": "Carefully constructed horror game relies on positioning, camera work, and shocking content. But Amnesia: The Dark Descent adds psychological elements to it. Players control the young man named Daniel, who wakes up in a seemingly empty castle, alone and with a massive memory loss. Through environmental storytelling, notes, audio logs and even visions, players are invited to uncover the deep-rooted secrets of the castle. \r\nThroughout the game players will be introduced to the mechanics of Sanity, representing the mental state of Daniel which can be affected by lack of light, visions and even unpleasant encounters with the monsters. When decreased, Sanity will distort the vision of the player to a different and seemingly random effect, in order to depict actual effects of severe anxiety. Most of the game challenges are completed through the item search and physics puzzles, forcing players to be resourceful and courageous.\r\nThe game supports modding, and allows user-created content alongside the free DLC Justine, telling a story of a female prisoner. Given how short the DLC story is - several possible endings are available.",

However, instead of protecting your base from waves of enemies, in this game, you try to break into aliens' facilities. \nThe story is set in the near future when an alien spacecraft falls on Earth. As the head of an investigation team, you need to explore the anomalies happening around the parts of the ship and find out the information about the catastrophe. As the section of the spacecraft landed in several cities, game events take place around the world.  \nThe core gameplay is reversed tower defense mechanics. You have several armor units in the convoy; however, you can't manage them directly. Instead, you need to set paths for them through the city streets and use different boosts to make your attack more effective and help the convoy survive. \nAnomaly: Warzone Earth is followed by Anomaly 2 that presents several new maps and mechanics including tower defense vs. tower offense multiplayer mode.",

    "description": "You control a nameless and faceless protagonist, who starts in a white chamber in the center of a high-tech maze. Your goal is to move forward through the maze by solving many difficult and intricate puzzles. Antichamber reminds Portal game series and Cube films to some extent, but with more emphasis on puzzle solving, sketchy graphics, and very little plot. Unlike in Portal or Cube, the protagonist cannot die, even if the player fails. There are no traps, and the only penalty for failure is that you have to try again. The protagonist is armed with a variety of “guns”, each of them allows you to manipulate a certain set of objects in the maze. \nAntichamber is defined by its impossible, non-euclidian geometry that bends 3D space in the ways not found in the real world. All the regular laws of physic do not apply in this place that seems to be straight out of M. C. Escher's drawings. Doors can become portals leading to an unpredictable place, or even different places, depending on how you enter them. The visual style of Antichamber is very minimalistic. Walls, doors, and ladders are only outlined with sketch-like black contours, while any color serves to attract the player's attention to a certain object. Everything else is blank white, which makes for a cold, neat atmosphere of a math exercise.",

    "description": "The game takes place in 1191. In the present time, 2012, bartender Desmond Miles, the main character, kidnapped by the Corporation \"Abstergo industries\", which with the help of a machine called \"Animus\" wants to find an artefact. He learns that he is a descendant of the assassin Altair, who discovered this artefact. They need Desmond to know the location of the treasure through him.\r\n\r\nThe game belongs to the category of open world projects. It means that the world can be explored by the player in a free manner there. All the game space is a simplified model of the Holy Land. The area is divided into seven main sections. \r\n\r\nThe player will have to climb on a lot of different buildings and towers. The architecture of the cities in Assassin's Creed is specially designed so that Altair can jump on any roof. Throughout the game, these skills will not just be used to perform additional tasks.\r\n\r\nAn essential part of the game is the investigation and the associated need to merge with the crowd. Each time, getting to the big city, Altair has to look around properly and find the office of assassins. The head of the Bureau will tell him about his future victim and will bring to some people who have useful information.",

    "description": "Assassin's Creed II is the second installment in the AC series, the center of which is stealths kills, exploring the world and enemy encounters. It is the straight sequel to the first part of the series and the beginning of the Ezio — the protagonist — trilogy, followed by 'Brotherhood' and 'Revelation.'\nThe events take place in Rome, during the Italian Renaissance (1476-1499), we play as Ezio Auditore and are fighting against Knight Templar, being the Assassins. At the same time, all of the installments within a series are connected with each other by the Desmond storyline: all of the enchanted worlds he travels to are just simulations achieved through using \"Animus\" — a particular device which gets in the DNA and allows its user to drive around their memories. \nThe game involves following mechanics — presuming the player to chase around some target, not moving to close, but not getting far at the same time; exploring quests — the heart of movement mechanics is parkour, and fighting — hero's arsenal involves swords, spears, and other melee weapons as well as ranged ones: bows, crossbows, and javelins.",

    "description": "Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the twentieth game in its series. It is the earliest game in the Assassin's Creed universe chronology and the prequel to Assassin's Creed Origins.\n\n###Plot\nThe events of Assassin's Creed Odyssey's take place in the Classical Era of Ancient Greece, in 431 BC, before the Brotherhood of Assassins was even formed. The plot follows a fictionalized story of the Peloponnesian War between city-states of Sparta and Athens that left Greece devastated. The player can choose to control either a male (named Alexios) or female (named Kassandra) protagonist, both of them being descendants of the famous Spartan king Leonidas. The player enters the plot as a mercenary and can side with either Athens or its rival Sparta. There's also the frame story set in the contemporary age. Its protagonist is Layla Hassan, who was also the main character in the frame story of Assassin's Creed Origins.\n\n###Gameplay\nUnlike most earlier installments of Assassin's Creed, which put the emphasis solely on action, Odyssey has a strong role-playing element in it. Dialogue options and the non-linear plot allow the player to reach several alternate endings. The game also has a reputation system and multiple options for romancing, including same-sex romances. The combat system is similar to that in Origins with the addition of new skills. The game also reintroduces naval battles.",

    "description": "Assassin's Creed Origins is an open-world action game developed by Ubisoft. It further continues the series after Assassin's Creed Syndicate.\r\n\r\nThe story is set in two time periods simultaneously. In 2017, the order of Templars has recovered an ancient artifact that will allow them to seize control over humanity. Assassins plan to get the artifact back in their hands. Layla Hassan relieves the memories of two ancient Egyptians named Bayek and Aya who create the Assassins order.\r\n\r\nLevels are open-ended which allows both stealth or open combat approaches. Players are put in an open world in which they can complete quests in order to either progress through the story, level their character up or upgrade their equipment. The \"eagle vision\" mode was replaced by an eagle by the name of Senu. Players can use Senu to scout the area ahead and highlight enemies.\r\n\r\nThe game features a heavily revised combat system that relies on hit-box mechanics rather than pre-determined animations as it did in the previous titles. Origins focuses on introducing various types of enemies that the players will have to learn about in order to defeat them.",

They go to London to put their orders there and at the same time to find a Piece of Eden.\n\nHowever, a more exciting innovation in the mechanics of Syndicate was the harpoon. It is actively used during a secretive passage - harpoon allows you to change position and save time instantly.\n\nAnother important aspect of the game is the gang. You can spend money and resources not only on yourself but also on your allies. By investing in the development of Rooks, you will help them to sabotage the Gallows.

    "description": "Assassin's Creed III is the fifth game of the series, preceded by the first chapter taking place in the time of the Third Crusade and by the Ezio trilogy, positioning itself in the times of the Italian Renaissance (1476-1499). It is the 3rd person action adventure with an accent on exploring and hunting\nDuring the new installment, the player is set to make way through the American Revolution, while being on both side of a conflict — our hero has English father and Mohawk mother, which tears him apart. Such conflicts serve as the leitmotif through the entirety of a game — not only we are choosing sides to fight on in the Civil War, but also we are facing the decisions of choosing Assassins' or Templar's side.\nAs it is common in the Assasin's Creed games, the gameplay concentrates profoundly around fighting the multiple enemies all at once, parkouring off walls and micro-management: selling resources, exchanging ships and so on. The Assassin's Creed III, however, highlights the hunting and simultaneous use of two weapons as the new in-game features.",

    "description": "In the primary game mode, two pre-selected character teams battle with each other to destroy the Solar Collector of another team that is inside the enemy base. Both sides are making their way through fights, fighting live opponents, drones and turrets.\nEach level adds value to the capabilities of the entire team - adds strength to attacks and health. At the beginning of the game, all these indicators are equal to 1, and by the end reach 20.\nThe game space includes health packages and Solar units - it is a currency that has circulation inside the game. The currency is added to each member of the team at each destruction of the enemy - regardless of who exactly the enemy destroyed. The accumulation of currency opens up other characters and the possibility of their customisation. Destroying the turret gives the team a super-drone, which is very useful when attacking an enemy base.",

    "description": "BEEP is an indie 2D platformer with a heavy reliance on physics laws. Big Fat Alien developed this title, and it is the only one within the IP. The game is considered to be attractive for such titles: not only it has music written primarily for it, but also the game flow feels like the one in \"big\" games. The main reception flaw is that game suits a lot more to the mobile platforms.\nThe core gameplay feature is the ability to alter the laws of the physics. There is an anti-gravity gun to do this — other than that it is just a general side-scroller platforming gameplay: the player needs to eliminate enemies, collect orbs to discover new planets and solve various physics puzzles.\nThe story is about the robot, BEEP, , sent into the Solar System to discover new planets and the possibility of life there. Once the Beep has unraveled the new planet, he checks on its physics and flies over to the next one.",

Quincy Sharp, former superintendent of the Arkham Psychiatric Hospital, became mayor of Gotham and created the prison \"Arkham City\".

The game has a \"Detective mode\" - the skeletons of enemies are highlighted, it is possible to conduct various examinations, for example, tracking the flight of a sniper's bullet. There is also access to a database that tracks villains in the city.\r\nAt a certain point in the story, you can play as a Catwoman. She has an analogue of \"Detective Mode\" - \"Mode of the thief\".\r\nThe visual decision and soundtrack are very atmospheric, soft, but give a clear sense of gloom and horror, entirely in the spirit of the plot and characters.",

Special Torture Attacks are present in the game when Bayonetta uses a torture weapon such as guillotine to execute an enemy. The Witch Time ability allows the player to slow down time after an enemy attack is successfully dodged.\n\nAs the plot advances, the player transforms Bayonetta to a panther or other animals in order to enhance her abilities. The game consists of several chapters with each having multiple parts. A scoring system is present in the game as a medal is awarded at the end of each mission. Special medals can be found scattered across the secret areas of the levels.",

    "description": "If someone has to live in the totalitarian society, that person has to work not to become a victim of it. Carl, a state-appointed landlord, has to spy on the tenants and to receive orders from the government. But to follow them or to dismiss them is up to the player, controlling Carl. Players will have to eavesdrop, bug the apartments of tenants, search through their personal items and complete quests, given to them by the higher ups. The moral choice system will take note of every action players will make, and every decision will have consequences. Much like in a similar in spirit game “Papers, please,” a government worker has to report any suspicious activity or anyone involved in suspicious activity. Beholder has multiple endings, and each of them is a compilation of player-made choices over the course of the game. Each tenant has their own personality, distinct appearance, conditions, and issues. It’s up to the player, to empathize with the lives of the tenant, or to follow orders.",

    "description": "In Besiege, you build impossible siege weapons and launch them to see if they will work. The game uses realistic physics system and was often compared to Kerbal Space Program. Each machine has to be assembled before use. The player is given a variety of modules to build from, and they include all kinds of weaponry, not necessarily medieval. Using improbable combinations of wheels, drills, spikes, blades, propellers, cannons, and water hoses you can turn your death machine into a plane, a tank, a robot, or rather something not found in the real world. Each machine is built with a purpose to complete a level objective, be it to destroy an enemy castle, slaughter the opposing army, or move an object to a destination. Levels include many kinds of obstacles, such as landmines, trees, rocks, and enemy soldiers. \nThe machines can be of any shape, however grotesque or impractical. If they’re not well-thought or too shaky to withstand attacks and obstacles, they will fall apart, catch fire, or explode. However, failing spectacularly is half the fun of Besiege.",

    "description": "This game is often called an \"interactive film\" - because the proportion between the given story and the possibilities to influence the story is indeed somewhat different than in most games. The game develops between three points in the biography of the girl Jodie Holmes. In these three points, we find ourselves repeatedly. And in general, we see 16 years of her life, from 8 to 24 years.\nJodie from birth has a gift of communication with a disembodied being called Aiden. In this context, the Jodie-Aiden couple can capture people's consciousness, move objects, and even strangle people. At the same time, Jodie is periodically exposed to attacks of vague energies.\nHer parents are not her relatives, they give her to psychiatrists and refuse her. When the family of one of the psychiatrists perishes, Jodie, with the help of Ayden, establishes a connection with the deceased, she can let the living and the dead speak.\nThe CIA is interested in Jodie's abilities and makes her become an agent. She then instructs her on several missions, but Jodie realises that she is being used for criminal activities - and refuses to cooperate with the CIA. CIA agents do not leave her alone, and she destroys them.\nThe game has a lot of interpretations of what is happening in the world of the dead, different people use Jodi's forces in different ways. Jody herself also does not have a clear picture, she seeks and finds real parents, helps different people - but they rarely pay her the same.",

Its successor is Bioshock Infinite.\nYou play as Big Daddy — a giant mech with a drill replacing one of the hands. The game, while they both are telling the story of a charming Rapture — the city descended from Orwell's and Zamyatin's pages where the society's greatest mind have suffered a severe decline.\nThe central feature of the game is the unique abandoned city's aesthetics — minding the time Bioshock 2 is still a beautiful title, with detailed drawn water and strange surroundings, never mind the variety of foes.\nThe remaster introduces a 4k resolution — it is now more enjoyable to explore Rapture and enjoy its various landscapes and sea-filled quarters. Among the other features: high-res textures and a set of Protector Trials,  which can give the player freakish weaponry and ammunition.",

By retrieving EVE, you will be able to fill your resources and use plasmid once more. Although the economics of the game is more complicated as you need to gather money for refilling resources and ADAM for purchasing new skills for your plasmid.

    "description": "Black Mesa is the original Half-Life as if it was made in the 21st century using modern graphics and updated mechanics. This remake of the classic game was envisioned by a group of enthusiasts, approved by Valve, and spent eight years in the making. The name, Black Mesa, refers to the secret research facility where the game is set. The player assumes the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist caught in the midst of an experiment gone wrong. An anomaly breaks out, and hordes of monsters invade Black Mesa.\nWhile Black Mesa and Half-Life are basically the same game, there are many subtle changes besides the improved graphics. The amount of ammo has changed, as well as the order in which the weapons appear in the game. The iconic crowbar is found in a different place. There are also new options like zooming in and out and reprogramming gun turrets. Some of the levels were shortened, and some of the monsters became stronger. NPCs became more intelligent, and they will perform certain actions to aid Gordon. Design of the characters also became more varied, and women finally appeared in the game. Black Mesa also introduced an achievement system and a multiplayer mode.",

Eventually, players will be tasked to find the first piece, of the Vault Key.\r\nBy being a story-driven first-person shooter with RPG elements, Borderlands allows adjusting the playstyle by finding different weapons, leveling up the character and improving some skills or attributes. Cooperative in nature, Borderlands can be played with up to 3 other players in total, where players can take the roles of 4 different characters: Brick the Berserker, Mordecai the Hunter, Lilith the Siren and Roland the Soldier. Some characters are naturally proficient in specific weapons, but players are not constricted to the skill requirements. When a specific weapon type is used often – the more proficient players are. Borderlands have several story DLCs that either shift the tone of the main game or expand on the existing storyline and characters.",

    "description": "The game belongs to the Borderlands game line, its action takes place between the events of Borderlands and Borderlands 2.\nEverything happens on the moon of Pandora - Elpis. The story tells about the formation of Hyperion Corporation and the fate of its head - Handsome Jack, whom we meet while in the role of a simple programmer who dreams to find some valuable artifact. In the game there are various innovations - in the plot, in the characters, in the scenarios of missions and in the setting. For example, on the Pandora satellite, gravity is much weaker, but there is no oxygen at all. Therefore, the task of obtaining oxygen becomes very important for everyone. Moreover, oxygen is needed not only for breathing, but also for the functioning of personal jetpacks and long high jumps. In the game there is another additional story and downloadable content, including new characters and story campaigns.",

    "description": "Braid is a traditional platform game with puzzle solving. The story follows the main character Tim on his way through twisted 2D levels. According to the storyline, Tim’s aim is to rescue the princess from a monster. In the course of the completion, players will be able to get some additional information about the protagonist’s relationship with the princess. Players control the protagonist as he climbs platforms, jumps on the enemies to defeat them and to collect keys to hidden quests and mosaic parts. Players have to lead Tim through 6 worlds, each based on an intriguing time mechanic, as Tim features the ability to rewind the original pace of time. For example, Time and Forgiveness world allows respawning Tim after his death by switching time back. To attend the last level, Tim must assemble the mosaic. The story ends in the world simply called “1”, where time flows in reverse and returns to the normal pace by rewinding. The last room of the final world contains Tim’s meeting with the princess, but, due to the time pace turned back, players face some unpredictable twists of the plot.",

Actually, players are going to assume roles of several protagonists (all are Bros) while completing game levels. The main idea is to make a parody of fictional movie heroes of the 80s - 90s. During the levels Bros fight against terrorists in the setting of games of the 80s to rescue other Bros. The gameplay features special combat mechanics: each Bro has two different attacks (first is constant and endless, while the second requires recharging) and a melee weapon to climb the obstacles. However, enemies can be also defeated by using distracting maneuvers. Bros also have special abilities like parkour skill or explosion resistance. The level can be completed only if another Bro is rescued, terrorists with their boss are eliminated, and the American flag is set on the enemies’ base. After each mission, the location explodes and Bros fly away by helicopter.",

The action takes place in an imaginary universe shown in a 2.5D perspective. The gameplay is divided into two main storylines, so players are able to assume the roles of both Vella Tartine and Shay Volta. The game allows switching characters at any time. Firstly, events move players to Sugar Bunting town occupied by fictional monsters called Mogs, which demand a sacrifice of young girls every 14 years. Once the protagonist Vella finds herself chosen to be the sacrificed maiden. As she tries to stay alive, she realizes that the only way out is to fight the monster and to liberate her hometown. The second story tells about Shay, a lone boy imprisoned in a spaceship between two AI systems. The boy seeks independence and starts to explore the entire ship then moving to the whole war-torn galaxy. Both storylines are not expected to connect somehow, but in the course of completion game levels, players start to notice similar slight details.",

With their mother dead and father being heavily ill, the only way to save is to bring water from the Tree of Life. But on their way, they will have to challenge the world and themselves. Villages, mountains and forests, bullies, trolls and wolves will await Naiee and Naia on their journey. \r\n\r\nWith having such setup, the game found a perfect way to portray this world to the audience. The beautiful visual style and something in between adventure and a platformer make the game an exciting experience. Although that is not the most curious thing about the game. With having two brothers involved in a story, the game actually gives you an opportunity to control both of them. You can solve puzzles by simultaneously moving both of the characters. For example, one of your heroes must distract an enemy, and another is supposed to go behind. This amazing feature provides you with one of the most unique experiences as you play two characters at once.",

When using his V-guitar named Clementine, Eddie can cast spells, called Solos, by a simple rhythm game, reminiscent of Guitar Hero.

    "description": "Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box is an extended version of the original Burnout Paradise game. The game offers action racing that sometimes resembles the demolition derby in an open-world setting of Paradise City. The game has a remarkable damage system that improves the whole experience and interrupts monotonous moves across the city, which is free-to-explore for the first time in a series. With The Ultimate Box edition, developers added day/night time cycles and dynamic weather system, so graphics became much better. Changes also affected the gameplay. Now players can race and explore the entire map of the city either by car or by bike that were also added. The racing career begins at the dump, where the driver, controlled by players, gets their first car and two new bikes. Players complete races and fill the “driving license” scale to upgrade the level and to open new cars and events. The free roam mode itself is also an integral part of the gameplay: while traveling across the map drivers are able to perform various stunts and unlock special achievements for the “license” experience.",

    "description": "Call of Duty: Black Ops is a first-person shooter, a seventh installment in the series altogether and a sequel to Call of Duty: World at War. The game takes place during the Cold War and shows different historical periods of it.\r\nThe main character is a CIA agent, set out on different classified missions and tasked with eliminating enemies if needed. The story in the game is complicated, featuring characters from the previous games, and historical figures like JFK and Fidel Castro. Despite its emphasis on the scenario and real-world plausibility, Black Ops doesn’t lack in gameplay terms, as the combat system is, as established in series, extensive and realistic. The graphics are made for the player’s highest level of entertainment, with massive special effects and excellent quality of every detail.\r\nCall of Duty: Black Ops features a trademark multiplayer system, with different game modes, competitive play, and cooperative maps. The players can earn ranks for their performance, unlock new customizable weapons and different perks for use in the upcoming battles.",

    "description": "Call of Duty: Black Ops II is a first-person shooter, a direct sequel to Call of Duty: Black Ops that features its protagonists. The story is divided into two time periods. It starts in 1986 with Alex Mason that has to return to work after his retirement to catch Raul Menendez, responsible for multiple crimes. The second storyline takes place in 2025; you play as David, Mason’s son, who also needs to find Menendez who sparks the second Cold War. The game has several endings depending on your actions in both storylines.\nThe campaign mode in Black Ops II is also selected in two parts. There are story missions, where you can make decisions that will affect the future of the characters. Additionally, Strike Force missions, available in 2025, feature permanent death - if the character is killed, you can’t return to the checkpoint, and have to continue the game without them.\nLike two previous games in the series, Black Ops II has the Zombies mode with a completely new story. It starts with nuclear experiments in 2025 Nevada that cause the appearance of zombies.",

The action begins in 2065, 40 years after the events of the second part, so the game has several historical references. However, the game is not a direct sequel to the previous Black Ops game. Players are offered to assume the role of a CIA special unit trooper trying to get along with the new artificial intelligence DNI (Direct Neural Interface) system and to solve mysteries hidden in it. The whole gameplay is divided into three usual for Black Ops series game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. The single-player campaign can be also completed in a squad (up to four members). Players are able to choose proper equipment and even customize the character before starting another mission. After the completion, each level could be replayed in a “realistic” difficulty or in a “Nightmares” mode (regular enemies are replaced with zombies).",

    "description": "Continuation of the sensational first-person shooter from Infinity Ward and Activision. It is rather difficult to maintain a high level of games every year, but it worked out in the sixth part of the series. The game continues the storyline of the previous part.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of numerous fast-paced gunfights. Classic hit points are not here anymore - after receiving damage, the player only needs to sit tight in safety waiting for health to come back. There are three game modes: the story campaign, multiplayer and Spec Ops. \r\n\r\nIf there are almost no changes in the campaign, and this is the same linear story, the Spec Ops includes 23 new levels for single or cooperative completion. Each level is a new task, a new challenge whether it is the defusing a bomb or the elimination of enemy forces. Levels are divided into tiers by their complexity.\r\n\r\nAs in any other game of the series, the multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2 takes a special place. Each match is a mission, for which you need to come up with new strategies to complete. As in the past, new weapons and perks are opened for the execution of tasks.",

    "description": "Gunslinger is the fourth installment of the Call of Juarez series of western-inspired games. The frame story, told in cutscenes, begins in 1910, in Kansas, where Silas, a patron in the pub, brags about his adventures in the Wild West. This old man claims he used to be a bounty hunter who took down many of the famous outlaws. Most of the game has the player re-enacting Silas's presumed past, while in the present the hero is narrating his own story off-screen. Silas is an unreliable narrator, however, and his own in-game audience will point at plot holes in his tall tales. \n\nLike the rest of Call of Juarez games, Gunslinger has every classic staple of the western genre. There are saloons and gold mines, stagecoaches, Indians and cowboys, sheriffs and gangs. The protagonist will escape prison, wander the Wild West, fight brigands and other enemies using a variety of late XIX century firearms, and occasionally sing country songs. Gunfights and duels are the central features of the game. There's even a Duel mode, in which the player can enter a tournament of gun duels, and the Arcade mode, in which multiple opponents attack the player. Gunslinger also introduces quick time events that allow the player to evade bullets.",

While making relationship choices throughout the daytime, Vinet is forced to participate in realistic nightmares at night. The setting of a title is two narratives folded one into another: on the outer layer, the game has TV-Show \"The Midnight Versus\" which tells the story of an inner layer — the adventures of \"Catherine\" world.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe gaming process consists of two stages, according to the protagonist's activities. While the ventures during the day resemble the usual visual novel mechanics: walking, listening to dialogues and watching cinematics pieces, the action gameplay reveals itself in the night. There Vincent has to climb a set of stairs by removing and climbing blocks to avoid traps. If he fails — the protagonist dies in real life.\r\n\r\n###Reception\r\nThe game journalists generally liked the game but were disappointed by the sexists and misogynistic stories found within it. The title obtained commercial success, and thus there is a remaster coming out for PS4 and Vita. The remaster was half-ready in late 2017.",

In Free Fro All the player with most points wins the game when everyone battles everyone in this massacre mode. Duel makes a tournament - one vs one fights of knights where only better skill or luck will grant you victory. Team Deathmatch is a traditional mode with two teams and scores that must be reduced to zero in order to win. \n\nWhat is not so ordinary for the genre, however, is a first-person camera.

Therefore, within the game players are able to assume roles of city’s principal architect and mayor.

Players have to zone the city, build roads, explore the surroundings, provide infrastructure and jobs to attract new citizens. Once the newcomers settle down, the immediate reaction is expected to establish public services and to set proper taxes. Progressing within the game and developing the city will unlock new upgrades of the urban environment and lead to the territorial expansion. The gameplay also requires the control of several city’s parameter scales like budget, health, employment, and pollution. The game also features a creative sandbox mode, where the architect’s imagination is not restricted in any way.",

There's no storyline in the game; in fact, it's an endless process of beating more and more powerful enemies, progress and get better heroes. There are microtransactions in the game; however, they don't affect your progress through the game. \nThe upgrade system is set around the in-game currency called hero souls that you can use to buy so-called Ancients that buff your stats. Hero souls drop from bosses you can beat on every fifth and tenth level. The key feature of the game is the way it uses hero souls to reset the game. Every time you want to upgrade Ancients and get more bonuses, you need to use a special ability that makes you start the game over. While you need to complete the levels and develop the heroes again, Ancients’ bonuses remain and let you progress faster.\nClicker Heroes is followed by Clicker Heroes 2 that is currently in Steam Early Access. Unlike its free-to-play predecessor, the sequel uses a buy-to-play model instead of micro-transaction",

One of the fundamental differences from other strategies of the time is the dynamic environment and complete destruction of almost any object on the map.\nThe game starts with the invasion of Normandy by the Allied forces and leads through Europe. The almost cinematic experience of every battle allows players to immerse in the darkest hours of humankind fully. The warfare itself in the game is exceptionally refined, featuring cover systems and different damage types, making players plan their movements, know their enemies and know themselves. However, not every battle is won by plans, and thus, reaction to the surroundings also plays a significant role.\nCompany of Heroes successfully reimagined how WWII RTS should look like and play like, with its different squad compositions, various routes to be taken, and new challenges in the form of multiplayer battles with players who will try to outcompete you, outplay you and overrun your forces.",

She works with the Federal Bureau of Control, a secret governmental organization that deals with the paranormal phenomena, often by annihilating it as a threat. The Bureau headquarters, known as the Oldest House, is taken over by a supernatural power called the Hiss. The director of Bureau, Zachariah Trench, is killed, and Faden is unexpectedly promoted to his place, while the ghost of her predecessor haunts her. She has to travel the endless corridors of the Oldest House and defeat the Hiss using magical Director's Pistol. \r\n\r\n###Setting\r\nMost of the game takes place in the FBC building, which is a high-rise on Manhattan. The Oldest House is a non-euclidian space, which is larger on the inside. Its corridors and rooms change shape and positions depending on the rituals its inhabitants perform. The Oldest House stores the magical artifacts called Altered Items.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe player controls Faden from the third person view. To defeat her enemies, she uses various superhuman powers, such as telekinesis or levitation. She also wields the shape-shifting Director's Pistol and the magic artifacts she can obtain as a reward for completing quests.

Originated as a mod for Half-Life, the developers were signed by Valve Corporation thus beginning the franchise that exists to this very day. \n\nHaving no particular plot or story at all, Counter-Strike was a competitive game mostly used as PvP. With new physics and a large amount of weaponry, you can choose between two fractions - Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists. Each team had their signature weapon (CTs had M16 while T had AK-47, for example), the main goal of every round was to kill the opposite team or fulfil a task.  In case there is a bomb plant - detonate or prevent, hostages - rescue or prevent from it or assassination. One player from the team is chosen as a VIP person that must be protected, and the goal of the opposite team is to kill this VIP. By winning every round, you received a good payment, by loosing - much lesser one. You can spend cash on buying equipment and weapon. Counter-Strike franchise is still loved to this day, and even such old shooters live to this day.",

The game also features 16 mini-games.\n\nCrazy Taxi follows the classic mechanics of score games: you need to get from a passenger as much money as possible. In the beginning you can choose a driver and a car; their stats are quite similar with slight differences in speed and turning. To raise your tips you need to reach the destination on time. To earn extra money you can perform multiple tricks, including drifts, jumps, near-misses, and combos of these moves. \n\nDriving through the city isn’t that easy as it seems to be. There are numerous obstacles in your way, such as frustratingly slowly buses, that make you take risks during your maneuvers on the road. Moreover, the amount of potential passengers is limited: once you pick up a person, it’s unavailable for the rest of the game.",

    "description": "Crossout is a post-apocalyptic vehicular combat game, where players can create battle machines from scratch.\n\n\n###Plot\nThe game is set in the universe of Hard Truck Apocalypse (aka Ex Machina), a game from the same Targem Games developer, and serves as its prequel. The game takes place 20 years after an apocalyptic event called Crossout. In 2027 a viral disease pandemic swept across the Earth, driving most people insane. Some committed suicide, some died when nuclear bombs were set off. Many of the survivors have mutated, became aggressive and formed gangs to patrol the wasteland on their hand-made vehicles.\n\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player has to fight enemy characters (in PvE modes) and other players (in PvP battles) using armored cars. Victories increase the player's reputation and allow him or her to join various factions and craft their deadly weapons. There are missions the player can complete to earn more fame, money, and spare parts to customize his or her car. The game features advanced damage model, which means that any part of a vehicle can be shot off during a battle. For example a player can lose all wheels and get his car immobilized.\n\n\n###Customization\nThe game offers a variety of options for customization. Every player can assemble his or her unique car from scratch from dozens of spare parts. The cabin and the frame are the only two obligatory parts, the rest is up to the player. He or she can enhance the vehicle with weapons, armor, accelerators and other devices to fit his or her driving style. However, the design has to be practical and balanced at least to some extent. Awkwardly built vehicles can lose control or flip over. The blueprints of crafted vehicles can be shared on the 'Exhibition', where players can like and download them, to create a similar car or improve the original design. Game also offers automatic vehicle craft system, which will build a battle machine from the parts in player's storage.",

    "description": "Crusader Kings II is a global RTS which takes place in the Middle Ages of Europe. The players will govern a house of nobility of that time, and ensure that its heritage will last for centuries. The second installment of the series fills the gap in the developer’s continuum of global strategies, allowing for lengthy grand campaigns and world conquests.\nThe main points of interest in the game are your noble house, holdings, and vassals. Players can engage in diplomacy between neighboring households, sign treaties and create a bloodline between two families, forge documents and declare wars. However, the primary competitive objective would not be conquering the world, but instead, winning the prestigious ranks and ensuring that your family will prosper.\nGameplay-wise, the mechanics revolve around interactions with your neighbors and your court. Buildings built, armies trained, but most importantly, your character should be built, too. Education, marriage, religion - everything will affect your lord-protege, and players often come up with different guides on how to achieve success without regards to the luck and skill of the player.",

    "description": "Darkest Dungeon is a roguelike RPG developed by Red Hook Studios.\n\nThe works of Howard Lovecraft served as the main inspiration for the game which addresses the themes of fear and psychological trauma. \n\nThe story begins when the player learns that they inherited a manor from a distant relative who died excavating the catacombs under the manor and accidentally released a number of monsters.\n\nThe player controls a group of adventure seekers that explore the dungeons beneath an old manor. Before every expedition, the player has to choose several heroes from the suggested roster and lead them through procedurally generated dungeons collecting treasures and killing various monsters.\n\nThe main objective is to save the lives and mental health of the heroes. Mental health declines every time when the player's comrades suffer damage, walk into traps or fall back from the battlefield. If the hero suffers a breakdown, they start to behave unexpectedly. During the expedition, the characters obtain their own traits - permanent behavior patterns, which can be both negative, such as alcoholism and kleptomania or positive like bravery.",

Two kingdoms, Heaven and Hell, could never solve their disagreements and battled each other from the beginning of time. \"The Charred Council\" arose in between two sides forming the brotherhood of Four Horsemen - War, Death, Strife and Fury. With these for horsemen on the watch and all the conflicts end, humanity has been born - a \"Kingdom of Man\". Council has created Seven Seals, that must be broken, when \"The Kingdom of Man\" will be ready for an Endwar. When our protagonist, War arrives on Earth, he sees that the final battle between Good and Evil already emerged without breaking Seven Seals. After fighting a demon called Straga, he is summoned by the council. It accuses him of destroying the balance, and that now the Apocalypse is unstoppable. Convincing the council in his innocence, War now has to stop the Endwar.\r\n\r\nDarksiders is a typical hack-and-slash game that lets you produce comboes with two primary weapons - Chaoseater and Scythe - and various gadgets. While defeating his enemies, War can execute them with brutality. The gameplay is undertoned with dark mythology bound with the present days.",

The Prisoner is basically immortal, as, in case of death, his head disconnects itself from the Prisoner's body, and gets back to the game's starting area. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game's heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac, as stated by the developers.\n\nDead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games, yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias.\n\nThe players set out to explore the island where a prison was built. As the players come down into the dungeons of the island, they find various loot, fight dangerous creatures, collect armor, abilities, and power-ups. Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. \n\nThe game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can't take multiple attempts to complete a level. The developers want the player to examine the enemy behavior and learn how to combat the enemies themselves.",

    "description": "Dead Space is a third-person shooter with horror elements. Playing as Isaac Clarke, the systems engineer, players will be isolated on the spaceship USG Ishimura after the crew was slaughtered by mindless Necromorphs after the failed investigation of the distress signal. Now Isaac not only has to escape but uncover the dark secrets of Ishimura, while looking for the clues about the whereabouts of his girlfriend Nicole.\nDead Space accents the survival aspect of the game, by keeping minimal UI and keeping HUD on the armor, making sure that the players can see the corners of the screen. Only weapons Isaac has access to are his engineer tools, which can all be upgraded with the limited supplies. Dead Space introduces a new variant of zombies called Necromorphs, that are highly mobile and instead of aiming for the head, players will be asked to attack the limbs, in order to incapacitate and slow them down, eventually killing them.",

    "description": "Dead Space 2 is a third-person action shooter including both survival and horror elements. The game is a direct sequel to the first chapter of the Dead Space franchise. The game is set in the space environment of the future. The story of the second part begins in 2511, 3 years after the events held in the first game. The main character Isaac Clarke is awakened after 3-year coma (after the escape from Aegis VII) in an insane asylum in the Sprawl on Titan. A soon as the event pace raises and antagonists start pursuing him to get his brains (for building a new Marker), Isaac realizes his only goal – the destruction of the Marker. Players are offered to join the protagonist’s space adventures to complete his main mission and to force a Necromorph outbreak. As in the previous part, Isaac uses a special Resource Integration Gear – special suit, which displays important in-game parameters including health and oxygen level (required for vacuum spaces), and which also serves as a gameplay HUD. In case if one of the scales reaches the zero point, Isaac will die, and the game will be restarted from the last checkpoint.",

The game follows a former park ranger Randall Wayne, who tries to get to a safe zone located in the city, where he hopes his family will be waiting for him. Thus, he has to move across Seattle to reach his final destination. On his way, Randall, in control of players, should avoid both zombies and members of self-proclaimed local authority gang called New Law. The game is made in a cinematic manner to transfer the zombie apocalypse atmosphere correctly. The gameplay is divided into levels and consists of walking through platforms and solving puzzles. Players can use Randall’s ability to entrap zombies by luring them into environmental hazards, and other mechanics of running, creeping and climbing obstacles to bypass enemies. Although the protagonist has many hostiles, combat is unavoidable in only a few situations. However, the game features some melee weapons with extremely limited ammunition, so the fight is going to be tough.",

There's very little interactivity and zero action; you just walk around a rocky Scottish island in autumn. The major events of the plot are set in the past, and we only learn about them through the voice of the unseen narrator - the only voice in the game – who will read a certain letter from his past when he approaches a certain place. The letters slowly unfurl the mystery around him as you visit various locations on an island: the lighthouse, the cave, and others. The world of Dear Esther is far from open, and you can only follow the restricted pathways. To unlock all the achievements and find every audio clip, however, may require several walkthroughs.\n\nThe Landmark Edition is based on the Unity 5 engine and contains better graphics, minor interface improvements and a system of achievements. It also includes the creators’ commentaries that provide additional insight into their narrative intentions.",

Rufus dreams of moving to Elysium - a planet where life is entirely different.\nHe calls himself an inventor, but his ability to invent is very doubtful, like his successes in life in general. He lives in the home of his ex-girlfriend and does not do anything useful. Nevertheless, one day he manages to get on the ship of the organisation \"Organnon\", to get on Elysium. He meets on this ship a girl from Elysium, but when trying to protect her in a conflict with the owners of the ship accidentally pushes her off the ship. The girl flies down and falls on Deponia. Then the intrigue begins, the locals build their plans for the girl, and Rufus returns to Deponia and, as it turns out, has romantic feelings for the girl (and still wants to get to Elysium). In all this takes part the mayor of the city and many other residents, as well as robots. The girl herself lost her memory of the fall, and the members of the Organnon have an intention to blow up Deponia.",

Although no one taught them this.\r\n\r\nThe plot of \"Become Human\" is built around three characters, each with a separate storyline, but they eventually merge into a single picture.\r\n\r\nConnor is a police investigator and android. He has a simple task - to find androids, deviated from the path given by humans. He has a special vision, it allows him to see events as they happened. And the more information he collects, the higher his chances of acting correctly.\r\n\r\nKara is an android-housekeeper which spontaneously develops self-consciousness. As a result, Kara assumes responsibility for the fate of the little girl whom she worked as a sitter for. She, along with the girl, escapes from the house as a result of a conflict with her father, the owner of Kara.\r\n\r\nMarkus is a caretaker android. He also acquired self-consciousness and came to the idea that androids need freedom. He has the ability to grant androids free will and to calculate the consequences of some actions.\r\n\r\nThe story develops depending on the decisions taken by the characters. Some decisions have to be made quickly. Sometimes a player can return to the moment of making a choice and replay the situation.",

Instead of fancy stadiums, the game offers you to drive through snowy landscapes of Finland and dirty roads of London's suburbs. In the career mode, you need to compete with other racers to gain the interest of sponsors. The higher your rank becomes, the more cars become available.  \nWhile DiRT 3 and the series in general is famous for its responsive controls and simple physics that make these games easy to master for newcomers, DiRT 3 features a quite challenging new mode - gymkhana. In this mode, you need to perform different tricks in a limited time period, such as drifting, jumping or spinning around. Gymkhana rounds are unskippable to progress in the career mode. Another key feature that highlights DiRT 3 is flashbacks - the mechanics that allows turning back time if you made a mistake during the race and driving a certain piece of the track again.",

It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’.\nDiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills.\nWith DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to bring the levels of thrill from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fueled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3.\nFeaturing classic rally racing that continues to build on the foundations set by the Colin McRae Rally games, the bruising contests from the official FIA World Rallycross Championship, the crazy battles of racing trucks and buggies, and the outrageous fun of open events in Joyride, players will face challenges from locations that span three continents.\n• OVER 50 OF THE MOST BREATH-TAKING OFF-ROAD CARS EVER BUILT – Including Ford Fiesta R5, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, Subaru WRX STI NR4 and Audi Sport quattro S1 E2\n• 5 INCREDIBLE RALLY LOCATIONS WITH MILLIONS OF ROUTES – Australia, Spain, Michigan, Sweden & Wales\n• THE OFFICIAL GAME OF THE FIA WORLD RALLYCROSS CHAMPIONSHIP – Race at Montalegre, Lohéac Bretagne, Hell, Holjes & Lydden Hill in a multitude of different series\n• LANDRUSH – Short-course dirt track racing in Pro Buggies, Pro-2 Trucks, Pro-4 Trucks and Crosskart vehicles in California, Nevada and Mexico\n• JOYRIDE - Laptime challenges, smash challenges, free-play area and send challenges to friends\n• DiRT ACADEMY – Taking place at the DirtFish Rally School in Washington, USA, learn the skills, techniques and practice to become the best!\n• CAREER MODE – create your driver, compete across the disciplines, gain sponsors and build your team with clear goals and rewards\n• COMPETITIVE GAMING – Daily, weekly and month-long challenges against fellow players from around the world\n• NEXT GENERATION OF RACENET – Live ladder, leagues and tournaments, cross-platform leaderboards, enhanced CREST telemetry system\n• TUNING – Tweak your set-up based on vehicle, track and weather conditions to best suit your racing style\n• DAMAGE & REPAIRS – Wear and tear is faithfully recreated with an improved and realistic damage model.

    "description": "DiRT Showdown is not a traditional racing simulator of the DiRT series. The only similar thing that relates Showdown to the original games is a high level of graphics: developers added day/night time cycles and dynamic weather system, so the whole picture looks beautiful. This game offers an arcade physics that focus players on their positive emotions. Even the advanced damage system is only a cosmetic feature because damages don’t really affect car running performance. Everything in the game is made for the spectacle. The vehicle range was expanded: imaginary monsters specially prepared for the demolition were added to already existing licensed rally cars. Racing experience covers picturesque landscapes throughout America. All the events can be divided into four main classes (Racing, Demolition, Hoonigan, and Party) and then into numerous types. Gradual completion of the events gives money for buying new vehicles or upgrading existing ones and opens new perspectives for drivers. DiRT Showdown offers both single and multiplayer experience.",

    "description": "Dishonored is the game about stealth. Or action and killing people. It is you who will decide what to do with your enemies. You play as Corvo Attano, Empress' bodyguard, a masterful assassin and a combat specialist. All of a sudden, a group of assassins kill the Empress and kidnaps her daughter Emily. Being accused of murder and waiting for execution in a cell, Corvo still manages to escape with the help of the Loyalists and their leader Admiral Havelock. Now it is your duty to return the Empress daughter and restore your name. The main focus of the game is to give the player a choice. You can spare the lives of your enemies by knocking them out or making others do the job for you or brutally murder everyone in the city. Gadgets are given by Piero Joplin, Loyalists engineer and by the Outsider, who gives Corvo magical abilities. The game reacts to your choices - grim atmosphere by itself can be turned even darker by killing people or slightly lighter by not doing so. It is only a player's choice what to do with his abilities. Basing on these actions the game will give you with two different endings of the story.",

It is a sequel to the original Dishonored game, so the story takes place in Dunwall and mostly in Karnaca 12 years after the ending of the previous part. To start the action, the player has to decide whether he wants to assume the role of deposed Empress Emily or the role of her father and the Royal Protector Corvo, the protagonist of the first Dishonored game. Both characters have their own bunch of special abilities so the choice will influence the way of returning to the throne. In the course of the game, both equipment and abilities can be upgraded. The storyline is divided into several main missions and includes various side quests that let protagonists get acquainted with the useful new skills.

Hunters believe that the Source's magic is dangerous and consider it their duty to destroy it.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, two characters are created, which the player will control. You can choose the gender, appearance, features and skills of the characters.\nThe game world is totally interactive. Almost all items can be transferred. For example, to make a barricade of them at the entrance. You can create strong combinations of objects. For example, tie a knife to a broomstick and get a spear.\nIn the game world, much is connected. If the enemy is wet, it will be harder to defeat him with a fiery spell. The player's actions also do not remain without consequences, especially immoral, such as looting and murder.\nBetween the characters is a dialogue. If it concerns a joint action, but the characters can not agree, the game itself will decide for them. It is interesting that the relationship in this pair can also develop in a romantic direction.",

    "description": "DMC: Devil May Cry is a hack-and-slash adventure game, the fifth installment in Capcom’s Devil May Cry franchise and reboot of the series. This is the first game in the series not developed by Capcom, but rather by English studio Team Ninja. Concerning story, the game is connected to the previous game and changes the cast of characters and even Dante’s (the series main protagonist) iconic appearance (which was met with indignation from the series fans at the time). The game’s story is notable for its social commentary regarding mass-media and modern capitalism drawbacks.  \nThe gameplay overall is very similar to the other installments of the Devil May Cry series and is heavily focused on fast-paced fighting with hordes of demons with occasional puzzles and platforming sections. The main change in the game’s combat mechanics is the Angel and Devil modes. They alternate Dante’s and attacks and special abilities. The modes are activated by holding left or right trigger (on the controller) which makes switching between them instant and allows performing complex combos, combining each mode’s unique features.",

    "description": "Doki Doki Literature Club puts you into the role of an anime character, an average Japanese schoolboy. Your protagonist joins a literature club in which he's the only male member. The remaining four girls – Monica, Sayori, Natsuki, and Yuri – compete for the boy’s attention. Each girl represents a certain anime character stereotype, such as tsundere, genki or kudere. As you get to know them closer, however, they turn out to have individual character traits on their own. Eventually, you will choose one of the girls to romance with and follow her personal storyline. The gameplay is based on interactions with the other characters and carefully choosing dialogue options. You will also perform tasks as a club member. The latter includes \"writing\" poetry, although the player actually only gets to select certain words to fill the blanks.\r\nThe plot and dialogue are front and center in this game. The visuals and soundtrack, however, are static and minimalistic: the music is looped, and characters have a very limited number of sprites in each scene. There's no voice acting, and you only interact with characters through text.",

    "description": "Don't Starve Together is surrealistic and grim survival game made up for six people simultaneously. Initially, Don't Starve is a single-player game with a core mechanic of going through various problems of your character. You have to sleep and eat well. Also, you have to keep your mental health all right and don't go completely mad at a situation, when these dreadful and twisted creatures are running towards you to tear apart. It seems like the world of Don't Starve is heavily inspired by Tim Burton, having a very grotesque yet creepy and bizarre-looking monsters and locations with an atmospheric soundtrack.\n\nWhile heading to multiplayer, you will experience every single problem from a singles game. The game exploits pretty similar mechanic to Minecraft - randomly generated world, surviving as a top priority for the gamer. With the only difference - if you die, you die. Permanent death of your characters increases the grim and tense atmosphere of the game itself, making the process challenging and creepy. Just remember. Don't Starve.",

Depending on the selected race, the player will receive specific bonuses and will be offered a choice of three classes: rogue, mage and warrior.\r\n\r\nAs in the previous parts of the series, the player controls not only his character but also a detachment of companions collected by him.

The game is considered to be the spiritual successor of BioWare’s classic fantasy RPG titles like Baldur’s Gate and Neverwinter Nights. Developers describe the game's setting as a mix of high fantasy and low fantasy. The storyline is centered around the event known as Blight, which occurs once in several hundred years and marks the demonic invasion in the world of Thedas.  \nThe player creates its character by choosing its appearance, class, and race. There are 3 and three races in Dragon Age. The classes are the warrior, mage, rouge, and races are human, elf, and dwarf. The combination of class and race determines the character’s background story and the beginning of the game. \nThe interaction between the player, his teammates and NPC’s is an integral part of the game. The game’s storyline often makes the player take moral decisions which affect his later interaction with characters and the game world in general.",

    "description": "Dying Light is a first-person action horror game with the elements of survival. It is a first part of the Dying light series followed by Dying Light 2. The game is set in the open-world environment of fictional Harran city. Players are offered to assume the role of an undercover agent Kyle Crane who has been sent in the quarantine zone. His mission is to find the rogue politician Kadir \"Rais\" Suleiman lost somewhere in the infected giant city. On the way to achieving the goal, Kyle will meet other survivors, who desperately try to stay alive among zombies. The chief game mechanic is running the generators and turning on streetlights throughout Harran to make another part of the map accessible and safe at nighttime. The game features day/night time cycles that change the game remarkably: the action becomes fast-paced, and all the infected people turn into dangerous zombies. Therefore, the gameplay is based on armed combat against mutants and Kyle’s sneak and parkour skill for preventing it.",

    "description": "Dying Light series introduces a world that was hit by a zombie virus outbreak. Under the daylight, zombies are weak and slow, but after the sunset, they become fast, strong and hungry for human flesh. You play as Kyle Crane, a special operative sent to the Harran city, which became a quarantined zone after the outbreak. In the expansion pack The Following, he learns about a cure for the plague, supposedly invented by a sect, and sets off to find out more about it. Crane will travel the countryside open world that is twice the size of the original game’s map. To fight off zombies, Crane will use not only a variety of weapons but also parkour movements, which are the definitive feature in Dying Light gameplay.\nThe Following introduces new weapons, several new game modes, such as bounty hunting which gives the player a new mission every day. The expansion allows the player to drive a buggy to run zombies over. There is a four-person multiplayer mode, and also the “Be the Zombie” mode, in which players can assume the role of a huge, powerful zombie. The Enhanced Edition includes the original game, the expansion pack, and all the available DLCs, such as Cuisine & Cargo and The Bozak Horde.",

EVE Online is set in an expansive sci-fi world. The player controls starship and has the freedom to explore the in-game world at his own pace. There are many diffident activities for players ranging from quiet trading, mining, and manufacturing to full-on real-time space battles that can last for many hours and include hundreds of players.  \nOne of the game’s main features is freedom of player interaction. Many aspects of the game such as economics can be described as player-driven. Players can form corporations and alliances that can conquer some of the game’s 7800+ star systems. This leads to a lot of unique and unscripted situations affecting in-game politics and economics. Another notable part of the game is that real-world money can be used to buy different items that sometimes can cost hundreds of dollars.",

    "description": "One of the interesting facts about Elite Dangerous is its realistic scale representation of the Milky Way which is an open-world and the gameplay is itself open-ended. It is the first game in the series to feature MMO-kind of gameplay, where every players' action affects the plot of the games universe. This is the fourth installment in the Elite video games series and it's the sequel to Frontier: First Encounters. This is one of those successful Kickstarter campaigns which launched in 2012. The pre-released version of Elite Dangerous was available since December 2013 and after one long year it was finally released as a full game on Microsoft Windows. In 2015 it was released on OS X and Xbox One and one year later  - on PlayStation 4. The game also supports VR devices including HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.\nElite Dangerous is set in a year 3304. Its premise, as with the other games in the series, is to start as a small ship with a small amount of money and then with measures of trading, mining, bounty-hunting, piracy and assassination to go up your career. \nThere are three different factions in the game including Empire of Achenar, the Galactic Federation, and the Alliance of Independent Systems and four player status levels (combat, CQC Championship, exploration and trading).",

    "description": "You play as a truck driver, whose primary task throughout the game is to deliver essential goods to Europe.\n\nThe actions of foreign drivers in the game are close to reality. It means that the computer does not only act following the rules of the road but also takes some other techniques taken from real life, for example, gives a sign that passes the driver to the main road.\n\nThe time in the game is slightly different from the real time (1 minute in the set corresponds to five-ten seconds of real time). The driver can drive in total for 11 hours, after that he needs to go to the nearest Parking to make a nine-hour rest. If you do not, the driver gradually begins to struggle with sleep and yawn. The screen becomes dark, and the player, in turn, loses control of the truck, what can quickly lead to an accident.\n\nIn the game, there are temporary and permanent road signs that limit the speed mode. The maximum speed of all trucks in the game is technically limited to 90 km/h by default (but it can be disabled in the game settings).",

R. - a fictional special forces unit, which is forced to resist the rebel squad of cloned supersoldiers. He also faces a supernatural threat - Alma, a ghostly creature in the form of a little girl. The game consists of 11 episodes with an epilogue. As for the plot, it is completely confused until the end.\n\nOne of the primary abilities of the player is to slow down time.  Being in this state for not so long, you can see the traces of flying bullets, move faster and get an advantage in battle.\n\nThe whole game comes from the first person, and the camera never shows the player from the side. Also, the game is often criticised for the fact that the primary action levels take place inside the buildings, not in the open area. But the player can attack the enemy from anywhere, hiding behind a wall, or create a shelter for additional protection.",

Unlike its predecessors, the game received a new engine, improved physics and graphics.\n\nA \"Pro Season\" mode was featured. This mode was different from the usual championship in a complete lack of interface and management assistance, as well as the highest level of complexity. The career mode, which was in the previous parts of the series, did not appear in the game.\n\nThe game is also compatible with the voice recognition  (available only on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One). With its help, players will be able to communicate with their teams during the race and learn about the weather changes, the condition of the car and tires, and to request an unscheduled change of tires.",

Even though it is a platformer game in which you solve puzzles in the dimension your looking at, you can manipulate with the world itself by rotating it all around. Because of that very interesting mechanic that is not so popular in the industry, the game is actually is a 2D in a 3D world. In order to proceed from one level to another, you have to collect cubes or fragments of it. However, by rotating the world, you can actually gain access to some places that wouldn't be available without this mechanic. \n\nGomez, our protagonist, must restore the order in his universe by passing through the levels and collecting little fragments of it. But he will face no threat at all. Your only challenge is to actually beat these quite peculiar puzzles, basically without any guidelines at all. As stated by a developer himself, this game is about \"stop and smell the flower\", which makes it a brilliant stress-relief or a relaxing sort of the game with slow gameplay and nice atmosphere.",

Noctis Lucis Caelum, the heir of the Lucis Empire throne sets out on a quest with his comrades in order to recover a stolen magical gem the theft of which sparks a global conflict between all the nations in Eos.\n\nThe combat system resembles the same one featured in Final Fantasy Type-0 but is heavily modified. There is no option to control any of the four main protagonists apart from Noctis himself, yet it is possible to command your teammates. It is possible for the players to use vehicles such as tanks or robots or summon beings that differ in rank based on their size. There are no battle-specific battle screens in FFXV.\n\nMagic is also present in the game. By consuming the power of natural elements from their sources, Noctis is able to cast spells. The Protagonists have the ability called Link Form which allows for contextual attacks.\n\nThe main emphasis is put on the road trip with your friends. FFXV features a massive open world which can be freely explored. Dynamic day-night cycle and weather systems are also present.",

You control a spaceship that has to deliver an essential package of data to the Federation headquarters. This data can help defeat the rebel’s army and finish the war. To do so, you have to travel through eight procedurally generated space segments. Within those segments, the player can encounter other ships and NPCs both friendly and hostile as well as random events.  \nThe gameplay’s key feature is that the player does not control the spaceship itself but rather the ship’s crew. During the game, the player can hire or rescue new crew members from different races. Each team member has its characteristics that affect how well he can handle different systems on the ship or his movement speed and fighting skills.  \nThe game is notable for its high difficulty primarily since ship’s destruction causes save files deleting.",

His main objective now is to survive and build a rocket to leave the planet. Luckily, the main character has a scientific background, hence why he can build any machinery from steam engines to exoskeletons, power grids, and oil plants. The planet's inhabitants start to think that they got infected by the astronaut and try to eliminate the threat as soon as possible.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls only one character that can move around the map freely by walking at first and using vehicles later into the game. The unknown planet that the players explore is rich with oil, minerals, water, and other fauna.\n\nThe player controlled character can mine the resources by himself and the tools that can be crafted or by building specific mining equipment. The latter will be much more effective. The same thing goes for resource processing and other stages of item development as from the game's beginning, the players can't keep up with all the things they have to do simultaneously.\n\nThe game features a Tower Defence aspect, as the planet's inhabitants set out to kill the player and eliminate the cause of damage to their planet. The players have to build a sophisticated defense network of turrets and mines to protect themselves.",

The cataclysm is the consequence of the nuclear war of 2077 between USA and China. The only people left on Earth are lucky ones, who managed to stay alive on the surface, and those, who made their way to the warehouses provided by Vaul-Tech (like the main character). In the very beginning, the protagonist wakes up inside the Vault 101. His only aim is to find his father who left the warehouse some time ago. On his way, he will contact other survivors (both gangs and singles) and explore entire restoring areas of Washington D.C., Northern Virginia, and Maryland. The game offers countless progress opportunities, so the gameplay is overloaded with various features including types of customization, numerous conversations with NPC’s, side quests – everything that an average player is going to face.",

It is the fifth installment in the series and is the first 3D and real-time combat game in it.\r\n\r\nThe game takes place in the year 2277 - 200 years after the nuclear Great War. You play as a vault dweller and set out on a quest to find your father that left the vault.\r\n\r\nFallout 3 offers the player immense freedom: create your own character with a particular set of skills using the role-playing S.P.E.C.I.A.L system and explore Washington, D.C., which has turned into a wasteland over the years without even following the main quest or complete every side quest you come across in the game.\r\n\r\nOne of the main features of the game is the V.A.T.S system, that allows the players to target specific body parts of the enemy. For example, if you target the enemies hand, they could drop their weapon.\r\n\r\nGOTY edition features all the DLCs that were released: Operation: Anchorage, The Pitt, Broken Steel, Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta.",

As an Overseer, you have to control the essential aspects of life in the Vault, especially: energy, food, water and the number of inhabitants. Your task is to develop and expand your shelter, as well as to fight enemies, to resist the attacks of raiders and other representatives of the Wasteland. \n\nTo obtain resources, you need to assign people to the appropriate premises, properly distributing their skills between strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck. Each character characteristic will affect how well he produces a particular type of resources and how high his chances to survive in the Wasteland. \n\nAn essential aspect of the game is the correct use of resources and their balance. And with a deficit of one, there are difficulties. For example, the lack of electricity disrupts the premises, the lack of water leads to radiation exposure of residents, and food — to the loss of health. You also need to protect themselves from attacks by raiders, mutated rats,  ghouls and other creatures.",

The game takes place in the well-known Fallout universe yet it does not continue the story of any other Fallout games released previously. For those who pre-ordered this game, a special bonus CD was delivered. It includes bonus mission for the main game and a table top game in the Fallout universe. \nFallout Tactics is a game about tactical combat and strategy and this time players have much more limited interaction with NPC characters yet they can still trade with them. The game centers around bunkers of Brotherhood from where the player has to go to missions after preparing for them by obtaining the services of quartermasters, mechanics, personal yeomen and medics. \nIn Fallout Tactics, missions take place in towns or factories, military camps or a Vault. In missions, the player gets a map with marked objectives and notes. Fallout Tactics offers a deep combat mechanic, which features three different modes of combat: Continuous Turn-Based, Individual Turn-Based and Squad Turn-Based combat types.",

However, the plot of the fourth chapter is unique and has no direct references to the previous games of the series. The story is now set in the Far East, where the new main character Ajay Gale joins the opposition fighting the dictatorship. The open world lets players explore the entire environment of Kyrat – a tiny fictional region hidden in towering Himalayas. Ajay as a Kyrati-American travels to Kyrat to scatter the ashes of his mother in her motherland, but suddenly things go the wrong way, and he finds himself in the middle of the civil war between the powerful dictator Pagan Min and rebels from the Golden Path founded by his father. As the story progresses, players get new weaponry and equipment or customize the ones they have. From the very beginning, the whole map is not available, so to progress and to complete the story players have to open all the game areas by “activating” bell towers (traditional Far Cry mechanic) for establishing the Golden Path’s radio propaganda and defeating enemies’ fortresses.",

The game has quite a few fans who are online and offline sharing tips on how to catch, for example, a Grass Pickerel.

    "description": "Flatout is the racing game with a heavy focus on destruction and associated with the drivers tearing out the front windshield. It is the first part of the tetralogy, followed by the three sequels and one remaster. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game consists of two modes: survival and racing. The goal of the racing part is pretty much the same as in any game of its genre: to reach the finish through the variety of lap tracks. The one to finish the route first wins. There are always eight players on the map with the protagonist and seven other racers — the game does not divide players into teams, every racer plays for himself.  While the survival mode brings a new experience to the genre cause the winning player is determined not only by the amount of the damage it dealt to the others but also by surviving as long as possible. \n\n###Key features\nThe FlatOut is usually noticed for the realistic physics and the destruction mechanics, allowing the player to ruin their cars in many ways with the different types of collisions being caused by the different kinds of accidents accordingly. Apart from vehicle impacts the racing game also features realistic driver-tossing-out mechanics based on Ragdoll physics technology, which was previously used in animated cartoons and FlatOut is the first known title to utilize the engine in the video games.",

    "description": "The second part of the FlatOut series offers a variety of racing options. This part of the series has street racing as its main theme. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game includes 34 cars divided by three types: \"derby\", \"race\" and \"street\". As the player's career progresses, he or she can unlock more cars that include everything up to school buses. Each car has its unique characteristics and may require different driving styles. The player can also upgrade his or her existing vehicle instead of purchasing a new one.\n\nIn the career mode, the game includes more than 30 tracks with varied environment and length. The levels often allow more than one route to choose from at any lap. AI-controlled opponents have personalities that define their driving style. Besides the races, there are mini-games that offer the player to perform stunts.\n\n###Differences from the original game\nCompared to the first part, the sequel doubled on the number of available cars, tracks, and mini-games. FlatOut 2 also introduced longer tournaments and online multiplayer. There's also an improved physics engine. The tire grip was enhanced, making the controls more sturdy, and the cars are now less likely to bounce off the track.\n\nThere's also a ragdoll physics model that defines the movements of the driver within the car. After crashes and during the stunt mini-games the driver may even fly out of the car. In some mini-games, the goal is to throw the driver's body as far as possible or to land it on a designated target.",

    "description": "Forza Horizon 3 is a racing open-world game developed by Playground Games. It is a part of a large Forza series including 11 titles in it with Horizon 3 being the 9th heading in the row. It is, however, uncertain to claim that there is a unified narrative in racing games, so all 11 titles more likely represent one universe, but do not come in specific order.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the title series does not follow a distinct storyline. Speaking of surroundings, nonetheless, it is safe to say, that the Horizon 3's scene is an Australia. The previous chapters of racing have pushed a narrative about the players being a participator of Horizon Festival. Now the protagonist becomes a host of the event, so they must play organizing roles, too. For example, hire drivers and adjust the racing grounds.\r\nThere are some events players can be a part of.  For example, drifting competition, Bucket List challenges and time trials. All of them utilize the same mechanics of getting to the finish line as fast as possible. There are more than 350 cars available, let alone DLC ones. 4-person co-op included along with multiplatform races between PC and Xbox One.",

Most notably, the players can drive on the ice when lakes and rivers freeze. \r\n\r\n###Cars\r\nForza Horizon 4 features more than 450 vehicles that are licensed by over one hundred car manufacturers.

    "description": "In an ultimately frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. The city ruler has to manage both the inhabitants and the infrastracture the citizens live in. Leader’s tactical skills face challenges, frequently questioning morality and the basic foundation of what we consider an organized society. Here optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.\nWhat decisions will you make so the society can survive? What will you do when pushed to the limits? And...\n...who will you become in the process?\n\nTHE CITY MUST SURVIVE\nFrostpunk is a city-survival game where heat means life and every decision comes with a cost.\n\nMAINTAIN THE HOPE\nSurvival is about hope and will to live. Your ability to spark and maintain these two in your people will be a determinant factor for success.\n\nMAKE THE LAW\nSociety is a group of people abiding the same rules and sharing similar beliefs. Establishing laws and customs will be a crucial factor shaping your society.\n\nWEIGHT YOUR CHOICES\nWill you allow child-labour? How will you treat the sick and wounded? Frostpunk challenges a player’s tactical skills, while questioning one’s morality.\n\nEXPLORE\nThe world covers not only bits of the past but also the potential means to secure the future of your people.\n\n\"(...) this is a game about finding reasons to survive rather than just the means to go on living.\"\n- Adam Smith, Rock, Paper, Shotgun\n\"In a steampunk ice age, the only thing that can be crueler than the bitter cold are the decisions you have to make to keep your people alive.\"\n- Stephanie Chan, VentureBeat\n\"(...) decisions push your morality to its limits for the sake of productivity, which could make for an captivating, draining adventure when the game releases later this year.\"\n- Suriel Vazquez, Game Informer",

    "description": "GRID is a racing game that lets the player dive into the motorsport, assume the real racer’s role and even control their own racing team. Races and racing championships are held in three main locations – the United States, Europe, and Japan. All racing circuits in the game are the mixture of imaginary and the existing ones. The gameplay is divided into 6 racing classes: GT championships, drifting, touge (climbing the narrow mountain pass like Pikes Peak), open wheel racing, demolition derby, and 24 Hours of Le Mans (additional at the end of the season). Each car of 43 available in the game is tied to one of the event types. Several professional teams compete within these championships. Therefore, to start the career player have to choose one of the disciplines and a professional team to join. While progressing GRID gives an opportunity to create your own racing team, hire sponsors and other drivers, and participate in different events. The gameplay also has a remarkable feature called “flashback” that allows rewinding time to prevent driver’s mistakes.",

Money is not needed, the main thing is to conquer the audience. The race will be held in such places as Paris, Hong Kong, Chicago, Dubai, etc. All the tracks, drivers, teams, cars and sponsors in the game are real.\n\nCompared to GRID (the first part of the series), there are more modes. There were races on the so-called \"Checkpoint\",  endurance race and other several options. And the significant thing now that there is no driving on the rails, sudden acceleration of rivals and unpunished wiping of bumpers (also, damage to the machine is not displayed on the screen, it is necessary to focus on its behaviour and the replica of racing engineer).\n\nThe main feature of GRID is time rewinding. The number of rewinds is limited, but with this, you can save yourself from a fatal outcome.",

    "description": "It is a new beginning for Kratos. Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, he ventures into the brutal Norse wilds with his son Atreus, fighting to fulfill a deeply personal quest. \r\n\r\nHis vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. \r\n\r\nKratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. \r\n\r\nFrom the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War’s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise. \r\n\r\nWith an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre",

    "description": "Grand Theft Auto III is an open-world action game, a part of the criminal franchise GTA. As the first in the series 3D game with high-quality textures, GTA III became exemplary in its genre. \r\n\r\nThe action is located in fictional Liberty City. Its map is divided into three parts – each becomes available gradually, depending on the storyline progress. The player takes control of the character from the third-person view. \r\n\r\nThe classic feature of GTA III is the ability to interact with the world: explore the map either on foot or by car, contact with other characters, visit weapon stores and shoot everywhere. Although GTA III is another chapter of the franchise, its plot is unique. \r\n\r\nThe story begins with the dynamic bank robbery. During the heist scene, the main character (silent and unnamed for the whole game) gets betrayed by his accomplice Catalina. By good fortune, the protagonist escapes from imprisonment and starts making both ends meet in Liberty City after being deceived. Therefore, his only wish – also the main idea of the storyline – to take the revenge on the former partner.",

Setting up in fictional state San Andreas, you follow the story of CJ, a member of one of the multiple gangs in the city. CJ's family is being attacked in drive shooting which resulted in the death of CJ's mother, so he returns to home from Liberty City.

You can steal cars, buy guns, hunt for collectables and do some side quests, while different characters give you specific missions in order to push the plot forward. Streets are filled with people as well as plenty of vehicles to steal. Fictional brands of cars, tanks, bikes are available to be stolen from any place around the city. Armoury contains pistols, rifles, hand-machine guns or a rocket launcher as well as melee weapons giving player freedom in anything he's doing in GTA.",

    "description": "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a third-person shooter with an open world. The game is set in a fictional city during the 1980’s and exhibits a unique design of locations, people, and objects, resembling the real world’s counterparts of Vice City, mainly Miami, FL. GTA: Vice City is a fourth game of the series, following Grand Theft Auto III.\r\n\r\nThe main character is introduced as Tommy Vercetti, an Italian-American mobster who works for a wealthy crime family. Throughout the story, the player will observe as the protagonist rises the ranks, sometimes making decisions of questionable nobility or profit. Our goal as a player is to ensure that Vercetti becomes the boss of all of Vice City’s mafia, and various story characters will help us or prevent us from achieving this goal.\r\n\r\nThe worlds of Grand Theft Auto series have long been worked upon and have been done in much detail, and Vice City is no different. The people on the sidewalks, the stylish cars and neon light clubs, the sky-high buildings and lively piers and beaches, everything will bring nostalgic feelings to those of players, whose eyes have seen the glory of this time. The gameplay, however, bears little difference from its predecessor, continuing the trend of big guns, explosions, and cop chases.",

The game is set in the Land of the Dead, which is a unique in-between world on the souls’ way from the mortal world to the spiritual one. All the in-game characters appear in calaca-like style, so the whole atmosphere reminds of the Aztec belief of the afterlife. Players assume the role of a Grim Reaper Manuel “Manny” Calavera, who escorts souls on their travel through the Land of Dead. The story progress depends on the completion of quests and solving various puzzles. Players, in control of Manny, are able to interact with the environment in different ways including dialogues with other characters in order to get some hints and tips about current puzzles. According to game mechanics, players can never fail a mission or the whole game. The Remastered version includes numerous graphical improvements including repainted, hi-res character textures and new, dynamic lighting, which are expected to improve player experience.",

    "description": "Guacamelee! is strongly inspired by colorful Mexican aesthetics and folklore. Your protagonist, Juan Aguacate, used to be a regular farmer until one day he found a magic mask of a Luchador, that is, a Mexican wrestler. His mission is to save El Presidente's daughter who was captured by evil Carlos Calaca. The villain wants her as a sacrifice to open the gates to the World of the Dead. In a cooperative mode, Juan is aided by female luchador Tostada.\r\n\r\nDespite being a traditional Metroidvania platformer, Guacamelee! is also, surprisingly, an open-world game. You can go in any direction in this 2D world. For example, if you climb down, this counts as going south on the map. Action in Guacamelee! is inspired by fighting games like Mortal Kombat, and the controls are very responsive. The monsters are varied and very Mexican: they include traditional Dia de Los Muertos skeletons, feral armadillos, and evil cacti.\r\n\r\nThe Super Turbo Championship Edition adds several new features, such as Intenso mode that makes your characters way stronger for a short amount of time. Health bars above your opponents' heads are introduced. This edition also features new enemies, levels, and even a new boss in this edition.",

You take on the role of a user nicknamed Bit and need to investigate the death of the previous \"Bit\" that was probably involved in illegal activity. To get through the story, you search for the files on other computers that can help to reveal the truth about your predecessor. \nHacknet combines a graphical interface with a text-based console creating the impression of real hacking software. As a rule, every mission consists of connecting to another computer, breaking its protection system and getting special privileges and access to the database. You need to complete the mission before the speed countdown reaches zero. If you fail, you’ll have one more try to finish the level.\nHacknet is expanded with Hacknet Labyrinths DLC that adds two more chapters to the story, new hacking tools, and a fully new soundtrack.  The game can also be modified by players.",

    "description": "Half-Life is the original game in the series. Being a revolutionary at the time, we follow the story of Gordon Freeman - a silent scientist at the facility called Black Mesa. Arriving late at work and hastily doing his routine he runs into the experiment field. However, the experiment goes completely wrong and opens a portal to a completely different dimension called Xen. The laboratory is destroyed as well as the facility itself, as unknown creatures like Vortigaunts are now everywhere in the facility. Gordon must battle his way to the surface and find a way to close the portal.\r\n\r\nOne of the main features of Half-Life was story-telling through scripted sequences within the actual gameplay. Without having cutscenes, the game was able to tell the full story of the game by showing scripted deaths, dialogues, character appearance while the gameplay was moving one. By not ripping off the player from the process, the game feels much more smooth as it continues. Despite his science nature, Gordon is masterfully using his weapons and destroys any enemy at his path with rifles, grenades, shotguns and much more.",

    "description": "Gordon Freeman became the most popular nameless and voiceless protagonist in gaming history. He is painted as the most famous scientist and a hero within the world of Half-Life, and for a good reason. In the first game he saved the planet from alien invasion, this time, when the invasion is already begun, the world needs his help one more time. And you, as a player, will help this world to survive. This time Gordon arrives in City 17, ravaged and occupied by Combines, where he meets his old Black Mesa friends. \r\nWhat is different, aside from the overall design quality, is the use of Valve’s Source engine that not only expands on the fluidity of character model animations and movement but allows players to interact with a myriad of objects with the advanced and realistic (to an extent) physics. Classic Headcrab Zombies are revamped and have new variants that provide players with different threats. For a story-driven FPS, Half-Life 2 is unique in its plot delivery, and making in-game mechanics feel natural, be it platforming or driving.",

Granted, single-player campaign of Half-Life 2 was impressive, but weapons that have been demonstrated in it made players curious. They questioned if the experience was complete because the first Half-Life included multiplayer mode from the beginning. Valve took the criticism and published Half-Life 2: Deathmatch – multiplayer only addition, based on the main game, which was a separate product, distributed on Steam. \nThe game includes two major modes, which are Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. Both modes have similar rules. Players must kill as many other players as possible, to gain points. Player or team with the most points win, and points are retracted for self-killing and team killing. Players can expect fast-paced matches with instant respawns.",

    "description": "Essentially a tech demo, “Half-Life 2: Lost Coast” sole purpose was to show off the new high-dynamic-range-rendering of the Source engine, it was a welcome addition to the franchise. It’s a free addition to the game that can be downloaded through Steam by the owners of Half-Life 2. Gordon Freeman founds himself near a group of decaying piers, fully armed and ready to explore the monastery above him, fighting through the Combine forces.\nHigh-dynamic-range-rendering introduced realistic lighting effects to the game, emulating even camera’s overexposure to the bright light, which was eventually moved to the main game. Lost Coast story is conveyed without cutscenes, every part of the level is tailored specifically to demonstrate the changes, made by developers. Even though it was originally created for the Half-Life 2, it was removed from the main game, alongside some minor story details. It’s not a full standalone game and wasn’t intended as one.",

All players are randomly spawned at the different map points and battle each other within a free-for-all brawl. To acquire any resource (weapons, ammo, health, and energy) players must scavenge the map for the various caches. Victory is achieved by obtaining the largest amount of kills during the match, by eliminating other players. In case of the draw, the player with the least amount of deaths is a winner of the match. Aside from the user created content, there are 8 available maps for the Half-Life Deathmatch: Source.",

Nevertheless, shooting scientists is not required, as the main threat comes out of aliens. The overall gameplay has few differences comparing to the one existing in Half-life, as far as it is based on completing the sequence of levels. Although the combat system looks almost the same, it features the non-player character’s assistance so the protagonist will receive support from scientists, security guards, and marines (soldiers, combat medics, and engineers) during firefights or while solving puzzles.

In case of having a low level of tolerance,  the scientist does not know the risks posed by the work to be undertaken. One morning Gordon was sent to a test chamber to perform a standard analysis of the crystal. The consequences of the experiment, however, are catastrophic.\n\nA distinctive feature of the Half-Life gameplay is the continuous interaction of the player with the environment.

Headsnatchers has 25 ridiculous maps with unique, yet unlikely, weapons and features, with their own steps and rules to follow. Well, they’re more like guidelines. Nobody likes rules. Dunk your buddies’ heads through hoops like LeBron, kick your grandpa’s gobbler through a portal to hell like Doomguy™ and flush your sister’s brain-basket down the toilet like the dooky you pushed out five hours after you shoved that XL pizza down your face. You name it, Headsnatchers has got it. Probably.\n*The online mode currently has 6 playable maps, but that number will grow as Headsnatchers continues development in Early Access. Custom heads aren’t supported in the online mode at this time.

With over 100 unique heads to choose from, there’s a head for everyone. Did we mention there are pop culture references? There’s a head that resembles that one angry guy from that anime you used to love, and one from a children's show with a certain mathematically challenged Count. If you don’t like any of those, make your own heads using the Headitor! You can save up to 20 heads, so go nuts trying to recreate those school dweebs who used to pick you last for gym.\nA SINGLE-PLAYER MODE MADE JUST FOR YOU\nSometimes you just need a little me-time - we totally get it. Rip it up in the single-player Zombie Castle-mode! This single-player feature spans across three different difficulty levels. “But, my dudes, every game has multiple difficulties nowadays”, we hear you thinking. Zombie Castle is different throughout its easy, normal and hard modes. Different levels, different everything, same zombies. We’re calling it right now: you can’t beat them all.

    "description": "Heavy Rain is an interactive drama telling the story of the investigation of a serial murder’s case. Players assume roles of four people – Ethan Mars, Norman Jayden, Madison Paige, and Scott Shelby – somehow involved in the case of Origami Killer, who is used to leave his victims alone, marked with origami figures. It soon reveals that all Origami Killer’s murders are connected with weather changes (actually heavy rains). In the course of the completion, players will follow the characters on their way to the key of the murderer’s mystery. Heavy Rain is an unusual action-adventure game. All four main characters are controlled from the third-person perspective with only several buttons, as the interaction with the environment is usually done by activating on-screen prompts like holding the trigger, pushing a button, positioning the stick, or all in one. The gameplay consists of multiple scenes, which affect the further in-game progress by the players’ choice and create a branching storyline that can lead to various endings including the death of certain main characters.",

    "description": "A dark fantasy game that takes inspiration from Scandinavian and Celtic folklore, Hellblade is set in a gritty barbarian world full of weird wooden structures and creepily masked enemies. \r\n\r\nThe player assumes the role of Senua, a traumatized female warrior from the Pict tribe. She suffers from a growing psychosis after her lover Dillion was brutally murdered by Vikings. Carrying his severed head, Senua sets out to Helheim, the underworld of the dead, to bring her lover's soul back. Her grim and bloody journey mirrors her descent into madness. It becomes increasingly difficult for her (and, thus, the player) to tell fact from fantasy, as she hears voices in her head and sees hallucinations. \r\n\r\nWhen not fighting her enemies, Senua has to solve puzzles to move forward. This is where her distorted perception actually comes out handy, enabling her to \"focus\" and see what regular people can not. The ghostly voices, recorded using the binaural method to create an eery effect, also help to guide Senua or to warn her about dangers. All of Senua movements, expressions and reactions were recorded through motion capture to make them more realistic and emotional.",

    "description": "There is a small little genre of interactive movies in the game industry, but it seems that not only Quantic Dream makes this type of games. Her Story also is an interactive movie video game which is written and directed by Sam Barlow. Her Story is about a man who is missing and the player has to focus on searching through databases of various video clips from police interviews with missing man’s wife Hannah Smith, in order to solve a case. \r\n\r\nHer Story is the first game made by Sam Barlow since his departure from Climax Studios. He wanted to create a game which focuses on story. He decided to use live action footage and created a police procedural game. In order to make it as much realistic as possible, Barlow watched lots of real police interviews, by doing so he discovered that there is a lot of ambiguity in those files and he wanted to incorporate that into the game as well.  \r\nThe game was praised because of its original narrative, character performance and interesting gameplay mechanics.",

The action takes place as a prequel to Hitman: Agent 47 (only prologue) and episodes take place six years after Hitman: Absolution. All contracts are being ordered by a \"shadow client\" and seem to be unrelated. But as you fulfil those contracts, you start to realise that all of the targets somehow are a part of a secret organisation called the Providence.\r\n\r\nWhile playing Agent 47, you have a large amount of free will in completing those contracts. The main target is all that matters, and you can do anything to kill this person in your style and fashion. You can disguise as a different person and infiltrate secured area to perform the kill manually or use a long-range sniper rifle to do the trick. Your surroundings help you a lot as well by listening to nearby chat or news reports. Players are given as much freedom as possible to find your professional style in the art of killing. A large amount of DLC and expanded missions can either give you gimmick-based contracts and travel to Japan, Serbia and other countries.",

    "description": "Hitman 2 is the seventh game in its series. It is the sequel to Hitman and a prequel to all other entries of the franchise.\n\n###Plot\nAs with all Hitman series, the game follows Agent 47, a hitman for hire and a member of a secret assassins' organization called International Contract Agency. His missions are tied together by a story that continues the plot of 2016's Hitman. The protagonist is searching for an anonymous opponent known as Shadow Client, who was also the main antagonist of the previous game. Hitman 2 also provides insight into Agent 47's mysterious past. The hunt for Shadow Client and his militia takes Agent 47 to new locations, such as a motor race on the sunny streets of Miami and a deadly tropical rainforest in Colombia.\n\n###Gameplay\nAs usual for Hitman series, the player controls Agent 47 from the third person view (switching to the first person when using sniper rifles) in a 3D environment. The game consists of several missions in which the protagonist has to assassinate various targets around the world using non-conventional tactics, stealth, and camouflage. Hitman 2 features an advanced crowd AI and an improved stealth system that allows the player to hide between the trees and in the crowd. The game also features new weapons, such as concussion gadgets that the player can use to knock people out.\n\n###Multiplayer\nThe game introduces a new mode called Sniper Assassin that allows the players to cooperate online.",

At the beginning of the game, the player visits a town of Dirtmouth. A town built above the ruins of Hallownest. The players descend down into the ruins to find some answers to his questions.\r\n\r\nThe game revolves mainly around the exploration of the in-game world, which requires the players to have some platforming skills. The players have to find secrets that are scattered around the level and battle their enemies. There is a certain degree of backtracking in the game as some areas are locked until the player defeats a certain boss or picks up a specific item. Each area changes as the plot advances so it may be surprising to come back in a certain area. \r\n\r\nThe Protagonist uses a nail which serves as a replacement for a sword. Players can attack in four directions. The nail is upgradable.",

    "description": "Homefront is a first-person shooter, set shortly. The game takes place in North America, as the United States are blown apart by a fearsome enemy.\r\nThe protagonist is a former US pilot, caught in the middle of the chaos that erupted in his country. Parts of the states are occupied, and police are rampaging in the streets, confronted by American rebels. The main mechanics of the game are shared with most of the linear shooters of the time, but the setting of the story adds a new flavor to the well-known system. The most prominent feature is combat and weapons, as the developers tried to make them as realistic as possible, allowing players to experience the hardships of modern rebels fully.\r\nHomefront features a multiplayer mode, where players can engage in fierce battles, arming themselves with various weapons and using different vehicles, ranging from AFVs to helicopters, to gain an extra edge over the enemy.",

The difficulty level unlocks after beating the game on classic difficulty. The difference is that all the levels are turned over, and contain more dangerous opponents.\n\nThe game has 13 playable characters. Each of them has their vision of the story, like Jacket and Biker in the original game.

Puzzles’ solutions are intuitive and make you act like in real life. In their core levels are quite linear: you need to reach the door at another side of the location to get into the next dream. While at the first levels you need to find exits from tiny rooms, the further you go, the larger locations become.

The gameplay is made in a traditional fighting 2.5D manner: battles occur in a 2D perspective but all the characters and objects are 3D. All fights are held in one-on-one form, where each participant has two life scales. Game mechanics are simple: three different types of hits and a special ability are available for each character. Some on-map objects are interactive and can be also used in attack. The main action takes place in a universe, which is parallel to a DC’s one, so occasionally clashes may look unusual. According to the storyline, Superman established dictatorship on Earth, and several Justice League members started resisting him. In the game, players are able to take control of favourite DC heroes and to participate in a war between Superman’s domination and the rebellion led by Batman. The Ultimate Edition offers players 6 new characters, over 30 new skins, and 60 new S.T.A.R. Labs missions. \nInjustice: Gods Among Us is followed by the sequel Injustice 2.",

Unlike other shooters, Insurgency features a hardcore gameplay lacking the on-screen crosshair, health and armor indications, and mini-maps. For the more, each weapon instantly kills other players with one shot in the head and with the maximum of 4 shots in the body, which is quite realistic. As far as the action is set in the timeframes of the Iraq War, the two opposing sides are U.S. troops and Iraqi rebels. The gameplay is divided into 9 PvP modes (Push, Firefight, Skirmish, Ambush, Occupy, Infiltrate, Flashpoint, and Elimination) and 5 co-op modes (Checkpoint, Hunt, Survival, Outpost, and Conquer). PvP matches are held according to 9 various scenarios (depending on the chosen game mode) with the maximum of 32 player count (16 for both sides). To start a match, players have to select a character class and proper equipment. In the co-op game mode, players are offered to compete with AI during the completion of a specific game objective.",

The action is set in a 3D fictionalized Tokyo torn by teen gangs clash. Things clarify when Professor K, DJ of the Tokyo-to pirate radio station announces a gang war between Japanese rudies (teenagers, who skate and paint graffiti for self-expression). According to the main idea, teens skate and paint graffiti spots throughout the city and dodge police forces. The story is following a 17-year-old rudie Beat, who, being inspired by Professor K, organizes his own gang to burst into the conflict and to defeat rivals. The gameplay is about skating across the city (using only a few buttons) and tagging all possible graffiti spots. In the course of the game, players will face troubles caused by police riots and especially Capitan Onishima (the main antagonist), whose only aim is to pursue the rebellion of the youth. Jet Set Radio also features cel-shaded visuals in favor of 3D cartoon-like picture.",

Reminds the best samples from the history of world animation. There is an impression that the directors and operators of the highest Hollywood level worked on all the scenes in the game - the hero's simple passage through the hanging ladder suddenly turns into an exciting panorama that you want to admire for a long time. Voices speaking the ancient Scandinavian languages, and beautiful original music help to create a tangible atmosphere of Nordic folklore and adventure.These advantages draw attention to the game, despite the lack of continuous action. There is no such action in the game, but when it does happen, its epic nature is suited to the world of Nordic fairy tales. Plots of these tales and a description of the world of Nordic myths are adequately represented in the game, it is even possible to study this topic. The gameplay consists of exploring large levels, searching for runes to enter the next level, avoiding various exotic troubles and rare but epic and picturesque battles.",

The player gets to know the story without words, but rather through cutscenes. The main character wears a magical scarf, which allows flying for some time, and recharges it with gathered cloth or simply by walking. From time to time the protagonist finds collectible items and discover ruins that can give additional information about the world or the storyline. The only way of interaction with in-game objects is a shout. \n\nThe game transfers the atmosphere of an absolute loneliness. However, during the journey the character can meet other players controlling differently dressed, but generally the same figures. Wandering together can be helpful for both players, as they are able to charge one another’s scarves. The thing is that both players cannot communicate each other in any way, except producing noises. Together players can complete levels and continue moving to their final destination.",

    "description": "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a game about defusing a bomb. It was initially made for virtual reality headsets but also supports traditional screens and controls.\n\n###Player cooperation\nThe game is meant to be played by at least two people in cooperation. Only one of them is wearing the VR headset or actually interacts with the computer. He or she acts as the main defuser who has to deactivate the bomb. All other players assume the roles of the experts. Their task is to help the defuser by reading aloud a manual about bombs. The experts need to be either in the same room with the defuser or to contact him or her over an audio messenger. \n\nThe defuser is the only player who can see the bomb. He or she has to describe it in details to other players. The experts, in turn, have to find the described blocks in their manuals and tell the defuser what to do to solve the puzzle. \n\n###Bombs as puzzles\nThe composition and other attributes of each bomb are randomly generated for each level, and the players can customize them. The bombs consist of individual blocks, which are puzzles on their own. Some of the blocks require regular attention from the defuser, while others can be disarmed once and for all. \n\nThe time for each level is limited. When the countdown reaches the end, the bomb will explode. Defuser's errors may also speed up the countdown or even activate the bomb and \"kill\" him or her. Each bomb has its own limit of time and errors.",

Even if we have all the necessary parts, engines, life support systems, rudders and accelerators, even if all this we have, the construction of the ship requires the correct arrangement of parts together with each other. Depending on how correct our decisions are, the ship will fly or not, it will fly right or fatally deviate from the course.\n\nThe game has three modes. The first is the sandbox. You can build everything that comes to your mind. The second is Science. Here you can experiment and improve technology. The third is career. Here you are responsible for the smooth functioning of all departments, including administration strategies, crew management, reputation, taking up contracts to earn funds etc.\nThere are also tasks to deal somehow with asteroids, create bases and stations in space, discover new planets and search for minerals in their bowels, and so on.\nThe ship's behavior is based on the real physics of such phenomena, the ship behaves naturally in this sense, and our solutions must comply with this. Similarly, it is necessary to take into account other physical realities, such as a possible explosion of fuel due to overheating and so on.",

The point of the game is to find all of the notes and progress through the plot, but collecting all the items is not necessary — it is nonetheless recommended to assemble them all to recollect the 1959 events. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe game is mostly about exploring and uncovering the mystery behind the death of the hike participators. There are some jump-scares involved. The gameplay centers around walking and hiding from The Shadows of the dead students— the only hostile characters in the game. With the absence of jumping ability, the protagonist has quite a few exploring tricks at their disposal. The game is strictly linear giving, however, with the ability to replay the main plot, collecting every possible note. \n\n###Key features\nKholat is often considered to have atmospheric and immersive experience thanks to Shaun Bin voiceover and the unique soundtrack; all of the above is considered as a softening factor for the games various flaws: a bunch of invisible walls, optimization issues and no narrative as a whole.",

A biotech corporation Horzine attempts to create military clones, yet something goes wrong and now the mutant clones are spread all around Europe. Governments collapse and the infrastructure is almost non-existent. \n\nUp to 6 players spawn on the map in order to kill the boss.

After the end of a wave, the players can visit the trader, where they can buy weaponry and equipment. Players earn money and experience points for killing enemies. The more players there are on the map - the more enemies spawn. The difficulty level is also affected by the number of players. The only difference between singleplayer and multiplayer is in the number of players.\n\nThe game features a class system. Players spawn with level 0 and can level themselves up to level 25. Each class is better in one field of combat. For example, medics have a speed boost and can heal other players while supports are able to seal the doors.",

Neo-noir action-adventure, L.A. Noire allows players to solve crime cases through collecting clues, collecting witness statements and interrogation. Highly detailed facial animation allows players to detect the exact emotion witness or suspect is expressing, and it can become a leading hint in a case. Slow and meticulous crime solving is broke up by fast-paced action scenes including car chases, gunfights and hand to hand combat.\r\nAfter every case player’s performance will be graded by 1-5 star rating, depending on how they acted during interrogations and how well they searched for the clues. Aside from the main story cases, detective Cole can be involved into optional side-investigations, known as Street Crimes.",

    "description": "LEGO The Hobbit is another installment in the LEGO series of games adapted from popular movie franchises. It is based on the first two films in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film trilogy, that was, in turn, adapted from John R.R. Tolkien's book of the same name. Like with all LEGO games, its visual style imitates a world that is entirely made of LEGO constructions and inhabited by mini-figures.\n\n###Plot\nThe game follows the plot of the movies rather than the original book. LEGO The Hobbit recreates The Hobbit story using voice samples from the movies, while also parodying it with the addition of the tongue-in-cheek humor. The plot takes place in the high fantasy world of Middle-Earth. Bilbo Baggins, the main protagonist, is a hobbit. He lived a peaceful life until one day a company of thirteen dwarves and the wizard named Gandalf called him to join them on an adventure. Bilbo and his new friends left out on a quest to reconquer the dwarves' home, the Lonely Mountain, and its treasures from the wicked dragon Smaug. \n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls the Thorin's party, switching between characters when needed. Each character has his unique abilities, such as climbing or shooting arrows. The game is divided into a series of short, linear levels that correspond to certain scenes in the movies. On the way, the player has to smash objects made of LEGO and sometimes use them to assemble new objects. The game also has a cooperative multiplayer for two.",

    "description": "Lethal League - the opportunity to express the most criminal desires. For example, to pierce the face of your opponent. But not directly - in the process of playing baseball.\n\nYou can play six characters on seven rings.\n\nAnti-gravity ball with each stroke accelerates from the speed of the turtle to supersonic speed. Every fifth hit allows you to use a special trick. Each character in the reserve has a pair of very peculiar ways to drive the ball right into the opponent's face. For example, such techniques as acceleration or deceleration of the ball. As a result of using these techniques, the game can obviously become much shorter or stretch in time.\n\nThere are three game modes.

    "description": "Interactive storytelling and plot-heavy games gained popularity, and “Life is Strange” arrived as teen mystery adventure. The plot will go through the life of Maxine, a teenager in possession of curious power, allowing her to stop and rewind time, in order to manipulate her surroundings. Max, after the reunion with her friend Chloe, is on the path to uncovering the secrets of Arcadia Bay. Players will have to deal with puzzle solving through the fetch quests, in order to change the world around them. \nThe game puts players in situations, where they’re forced to make a moral choice, going through the decision which may have short-term or long-term consequences. Every choice made by the player will trigger the butterfly effect, surrounding the first playthrough of the game with a lot of emotional struggle, thoughtfully crafted by the developers at Dontnod Entertainment. Life is Strange is third person adventure game, where players might seem just as an observer of the stories, unfolding in front of them.",

    "description": "This popular 2D puzzle-platformer creates the atmosphere of isolation, where the player alone can guide the nameless protagonist to his destination. Hostile environments and one-hit deaths may seem difficult, but the game implements a fair amount of checkpoints. The monochrome color palette showcases cartoony proportions of every living thing while making lack of details threatening. Limbo shows you exactly what you encounter, but never how it looks.\n\nLimbo uses the atmosphere and sound design of the horror genre while avoiding tropes of the modern horror games. The overarching theme and unique style compensated for the rather short game with an abrupt ending, making Limbo one of the most impactful games for the genre.\n\nThe simple controls and easy-to-pick-up mechanics help to make a clear distinction, which part of the stage players can interact with, and which part can lead to the quick death. Even though the game is in black and white, this separation is intuitive and natural, so the player would know exactly where to go or what to do.",

Initially released for arcade platform, the game shares gameplay mechanics with its predecessors, where the player takes control of a squad of four soldiers and faces continuous waves of enemies throughout each level.\nThe game’s plot follows the previous events, where the main characters succeeded in overthrowing a maniac and bringing relative peace. This time, however, it is revealed that our heroes' nemesis is back for more, with new allies and new soldiers to try and stop the protagonists. As the levels progress, the player faces different enemies, each with unique patterns and abilities, and also finds new weapons and upgrades for his character of choice. Another feature of the series is its vehicles, including tanks, planes, helicopters and even a spaceship. Each of those can be used to the various extent and provide significant bonuses to character’s firepower, defense, or movement capabilities.\nThe game is made using pixel graphics, and even though it was initially released in 2000, the sceneries and the details are still as stunning. Each character’s looks are refined, explosions are made colorful and as realistic for a 2D game as possible, and the locations themselves would look like art.",

However, one of the gang members decided to attack the mayor, infecting his brain with parasites. The mayor manages to call the robot scavenger that will send the bandit to a dump. However, the scavenger by mistake sucks the cleaner Joseph (you play as him). And the bandit washes off, kidnaping Joseph's girlfriend, Berta. From this moment the game begins. \n\nThe most significant difference from other games made in this genre is that the interaction occurs only with those objects that the protagonist can reach. You can also increase and decrease your height (three positions: low standard and high). Also in the game, there are no dialogues, instead of which the system of animated clouds of thoughts is used.",

Starting to work for Alberto Clemente, Vito must go through every aspect of being a part of the family and become a big thing in it.\r\n\r\nEven though the game has an open world mechanic, you won't probably explore it. Travelling to missions give an opportunity to listen to music of this time in America - Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Dean Martin and others, providing the game with a great atmosphere of the USA in its 50s. The gameplay has a variety of missions to offer, in which you can confront your enemies in melee combat, shoot them with different guns like M1911 or Thompson, or stealthily engaging your opponents. The game is pretty strict to the player reaching highest of empathy with Vito and every situation he's in.",

A great part of the game includes driving with realistic mechanics and sounds. There’s also a system of the governmental response to the crimes you commit that affects the playthrough.",

    "description": "Magicka is a fun franchise. Based on Scandinavian mythology, we follow a story of four mages that have formed an order to protect Midgard from a warlock. Yet this warlock is just a pawn in the greater game of a demon Assatur, who wants to destroy wants to destroy the homeland of the mages. The game gives few nods towards some other known franchises as Warhammer, Warcraft or even Star Wars.\r\n\r\nGaming process is very complicated. Having no character class as it is, every mage can create his unique combinations from eight different types of magic - water, life, shield, cold, lightning, arcane, earth and fire. Some of them are not compatible such as fire and cold because of their opposing nature, but the game deeply explores the way to create a unique gameplay-style based on your preference. Around the world, you can find magickas - scrolls that contain new spells and magic. Supporting up to four players at the same time it is a very fun game despite having loads of technical issues, like bugs and other problems.",

The game is the sequel to Metro: Last Light and is set two years after its ending.\r\n\r\n###Plot\r\nExodus takes place in the year 2036 in post-apocalyptic Russia. According to the Metro universe backstory, in 2013 the planet was devastated by a total nuclear war. The atomic bombing left many parts of the Earth's surface uninhabitable due to high radiation rates, dangerous mutated monsters, and anomalies abound. The last remnants of humanity survive by hiding in the subway tunnels (hence the name of the series). The main protagonist is Artyom, a former dweller of Moscow Metro. Together with his wife Anna, he escaped the capital to search for survivors in the Russian Far East (thus making the “Redemption” ending of the Last Light the series' canon). \r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe player controls Artyom from the first person view. Exodus introduces the sandbox open-world, although the game combines it with the traditional linear levels. Unlike in previous games, Exodus is set mostly outside the subway system. Thus, the game also introduces the weather, the day and night cycle and the change of seasons. The player explores the Russian wilderness during and after the nuclear winter and rides a steam locomotive named Aurora through Siberia.",

    "description": "Lord of the rings franchise brought a new title to the collection, an open world action-adventure game, that follows Talion, Gondor captain, that survived the sacrifice that was meant to bring the Elf Lord Celebrimbor as a wraith. Losing his wife and his son, Talion is merged with Celebrimor, escaping death.

Some missions might require special conditions for the greater reward.\r\nShadow of Mordor implemented the Nemesis System. It tracks the progress of every special Uruk warrior. Each special Uruk has a set of strengths and weaknesses, and players can assassinate higher ranked officers in order to promote easy to defeat Uruk to defeat them at a higher rank, weakening the Sauron’s army. This planning allows players to adapt, and use mechanics of stealth kills, ranged combat, wraith skills and head-on melee more effective.",

    "description": "Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a continuation of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor\nThe game operates on the world and the characters of the books of JRR Tolkien. However, it will be more accurate to say that the game is closer to the cinematic version of this story, created by director Peter Jackson. This is noticeable both in the visual solutions of some locations, and in the events themselves and their location in time relative to each other.\n\nJudging by the events, the game takes place between the events of the books \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\". However, in the game there are also such events as the fall of the city-fortress of Minas Ithil and its transformation into Minas Morgul - in books these events occur several thousand years earlier.\n\nAs in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, in the game Middle-earth: Shadow of War, the Nemesis system operates. This system provides a change in the world of the game and its inhabitants from the actions of the player. Therefore, each passage differs from other passages. For the game Middle-earth: Shadow of War, the Nemesis system has been improved.\n\nIf the player has the game Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, he can transfer to Middle-earth: Shadow of War some characters from the previous game - one enemy and one ally.\n\nThe player controls Talion. Taleon is obsessed with the spirit of the elven ruler of Celebrimbor. Taleon tries to use one of the rings of power to build an army of orcs and trolls and fight with Sauron and his generals.",

    "description": "One of the most popular games of the 2010s, Minecraft allows you to rebuild the environment around you. The world of the game is open, infinitely wide, and procedurally generated. It is composed of small 3D cubes that represent specific types of materials or terrain. The gameplay is centered on mining and building various structures of your choice. You can also craft items like tools, weapons, and armor. There's an option to shift to the first or the third person view.\nMinecraft includes multiple modes that dramatically change the focus of the game. Survival and Adventure modes require the player to gather resources, hunt for food and fight monsters to survive. In the Hardcore mode, there’s even permanent death. Creative mode, by contrast, offers you to freely explore the world and construct whatever you want with unlimited resources. There’s also a multiplayer mode that allows the players to share their worlds and engage in the traditional MMO activities, such as player-vs-player combat.\nMinecraft’s crude visual style, reminiscent of Lego cubes, became an iconic part of the popular culture. There are many myths and fan fiction surrounding the game, such as the legend of Herobrine, a rumored character that officially doesn’t exist.",

Each character has different skills and special abilities, so the squad should be appropriately chosen in advance. From the very beginning, players are able to assume the roles of four criminals: the Locksmith, the Cleaner, the Lookout, and the Pickpocket. The remaining four – the Mole, the Gentleman, the Redhead, and the Hacker – will be unlocked during the further game progress. The gameplay is about completing levels in multiple ways depending on the players’ character choice. Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine gives an opportunity to dive into the crime world and participate in heists and robberies throughout the world alone or in co-operation up to four players.",

There are six regions in the New World, each with its own base camp. The camps are where you have to thoroughly prepare before every expedition, gathering equipment and provision. Before you can fight monsters, they need to be tracked down using Scout flies and studied to discover their habits, strengths, and weaknesses. There are no character levels, so your hunter’s effectiveness relies on the hunting gear you have equipped. Advanced armor and weapons can be created using a detailed crating system.

To do so, he takes part in the deadly tournament called Mortal Kombat and has to fight every participant over to get to Shang Tsung and his monstrous ally Goro.\nThere are seven playable characters in Mortal Kombat, however, unlike in other fighting games, each of them has almost the same stats with a small difference in abilities. The core feature of the game is its unique control scheme that includes not only using buttons but also moving a joystick in eight directions. Every character has a set of attacks which can be performed by tapping a combination of buttons and the joystick's moves. The most-known element of the fight is so-called Fatality that allows brutally finishing the defeated opponent.",

The government cannot do anything with widespread crime, so it simply ignores that. Four street fighters from a gypsy community unwillingly become the test subjects for a new drug called Necro. After escaping from the laboratory, the main character returns back to their community only to find it in ruins and the whole population becoming drug addicts. The protagonist becomes eager to get revenge on those, who did that. Further into the game, the main character starts taking Necro themselves, which causes horrible hallucinations.\n\n###Gameplay\nMother Russia Bleeds is a beat 'em up game which is largely inspired by titles such as Streets of Rage and Double Dragon.\n\nThe players advance through a level, that is divided into multiple sections. In progress further, the players have to kill every enemy they encounter in a section. At the end of each level, a boss fight is held.\n\nApart from hand-to-hand combat, the players can use the world's items, such as pipes, knives, bottles, and pistols. One of the defining features of the game is the health regeneration system, as the players can pump Necro out of their enemies corpses and eject them to themselves. A choice is given - regenerate health or become a berserk that has much more strength and speed.\n\nThe game can either be completed solo or in a four-player co-op.",

    "description": "The hero is a policeman, talented and devoted to duty. But there is a clarification - this is a dead policeman, killed because of his work, but he did not leave the world, he turned into a ghost and did not lose his passion for investigations.\nA hero can do many things in our world, but not all. Can be present everywhere and even pass through the walls (but not in closed houses, only through open doors and windows). Can see what ordinary people see, read, think. But he can not take and move things, cannot talk with living people - for actions with objects and communication he has to find a girl-medium.\nIn the game, you need to collect evidence and draw conclusions from this. Ways to extract proof are sometimes very exotic. For example, a hero can penetrate the memory of a witness and find there information that the witness himself cannot remember. The hero can meet other ghosts, who were once people and killed - after talking with them, you can learn about the circumstances of this.\nFinding evidence and reasoning is not the only thing that you have to do. The hero can be killed a second time, and it will be definitive - some disembodied beings seek to destroy the hero's soul. But they are vulnerable, and the hero can kill them.",

There is an open world which is permitted to discover at any time in contrary with, for instance, Most Wanted, where the environment was zoned, and the locations opened as the story progressed.\nThe car collisions system has become more realistic compared to the previous parts of the game, but damage remained cosmetic only with no impact on performance. However, the car may be destroyed in Highway Battle — one of the game mods. \nThe title features some RPG elements — wheelman points, which grants the player access to bonus levels and car parts. \nThe police in the game are traced by the bar at the top of the screen varying between Busted and Evade modes. The capturing of the player results in the checkpoint restart.\n\n###Plot \nThe game's title suggests the protagonist role in the story — he is an undercover police agent given a task to infiltrate the group of street-racers to expose them to arrest. The background behind the races is taking down the criminal gangs and cliques. During the narrative player is faced with some dilemmas demanding a hard choice of him on which side to take.",

While the goal is the same - to reach the finish first, the game allows trying another side of races as you need to stop a lawbreaker in the police part of the game.\nUnlike typical racing titles, Hot Pursuit follows the principle that \"all is fair.\" That's why both sides have special tools to stop the opponent. You can throw spikes on the road or use turbo acceleration to break away from the pursuit. Police can block the road and summon a helicopter for help from above. \nAdditionally, Hot Pursuit features a new Autolog social system. With it, you can compete with your friends and see the statistics on every race. The system compares your results with your friends' ones and notifies you every time your record is beaten.",

The game is set in a fictional city named Fortune Valley. The player can choose between the three individuals to represent. The title features a real car — a total of 74 ones, and crafting system — many car parts can be tuned according to the player's liking. \nThere is a total of five challenges types: Race, Drift, Off-Road, Drag, and Runner. All the modes share the goal — to reach the finish. However, the initial purpose is altered depending on the race — sometimes one has to drift his way to the finish line, somewhere the manual transmission turns one, and the gear switching comes to be mandatory.\n\n###Plot\nPayback is one of few NFS' to feature ongoing narrative — the story of this one emphasizes the revenge theme. Three characters — Tyler, Mac, and Jess — are trying to avenge Lina who betrayed the crew from the very start.  Each member of the gang has its unique abilities — Jess, for instance, is professional intel gatherer, so she plays a role of inside agent all the time.

    "description": "Need for Speed: Most Wanted - A Criterion Game is an open world racing game and it is the nineteenth entry in the famous racing series. This is a reboot of the game with the same title released in 2005. \nIn the game players have to select a car and compete against other racers in various events like Sprint races, Circuit, races and Speed runs. There is also an Ambush races mode, where players have to escape from the police as fast as possible. Like in the original Need for Speed: Most Wanted game, cops can start to pursue the player during the race and as well as in the original players have to compete against other racers and if succeeded they instantly get their cars. The game takes place in a regular city called Fairhaven, which has a beach and an industrial district as well as the main highway. \nThe game was praised for those who are fans of Burnout series, especially because of its way of races where there is a start and finish of the race but players have an option to choose which way they want to go.",

    "description": "Need for Speed: Underground 2 is a cross-platform racing video game and the eighth installment in the popular Need for Speed driving game series published and developed by Electronic Arts. Released in 2004, it is the direct sequel to Need for Speed: Underground, and is part of the Need for Speed series, available on Microsoft Windows, Game Boy Advance, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS and mobile phones. Like its predecessor, it was also commercially successful, breaking sales records in the United Kingdom.\nThe game entails tuning cars for street races, resuming the Need for Speed: Underground storyline. Need for Speed: Underground 2 provides several new features, such as a broader customization, new methods of selecting races, the \"explore\" mode (similar to the Midnight Club series, in a large city known as \"Bayview\"). The City Center was based on Philadelphia, Beacon Hill was based on Beverly Hills and Coal Harbor was based on Camden, New Jersey, and Bayview as a whole is a microcosm of the west coast of the United States. Underground 2 also introduces several SUVs, which could be customized as extensively as other Underground 2 vehicles and used to race against other SUV racers. Brooke Burke is the voice of Rachel Teller, the person who guides the player throughout the game.\nThe game has been ported to PlayStation Portable, under the title of Need for Speed: Underground Rivals. The Nintendo DS port introduces a new feature in which the player is able to design custom decals to adorn any vehicle in the game.",

Despite the simplicity of the concept and of the controls, the game is very competitive, and many media called the game one of the best multiplayer experience of 2014. The name is consonant with serpent from the Norse mythology Níðhöggr, the snake appears in the game, eating the winner of the duel. The game draws inspiration from the game, which was released in 1984 - Great Swordsman, and for development used software GameMaker: Studio, which is available on Steam. Who wouldn’t want to create a game where you impale a friend, eh? \n\n###Key features\nPlayers get control over two game models that differ only in color. Controls are standard: jump, move, slide and throw the sword at your opponent. You can attack at three different heights: high, medium and low. Hit the opponent's sword to disarm the latter, and he will have to raise the sword again. The main task is to reach the end of the enemy territory. The first player who accomplished this wins. There are four different levels available for solo, local and online multiplayer. Later, the developers added new modes, like a tournament and the ability to use weapons differently.",

The information about the planets and their inhabitants is dynamically updated so every player can discover a new species or planet and give it a name.\n\nNo Man's Sky gameplay implies the exploration of space and planets some of which are inhabited with extra-terrestrial life, gathering resources, space battles, maintaining and upgrading the player's ship and completing bounty hunting missions. The main objective is to reach the center of the galaxy. \n\nOn release, it was stated that the game is in fact multiplayer, but the size of its world is so big that the probability of meeting another player is extremely small. It turned out that it is impossible to meet any other player due to the extremely limited multiplayer aspect. As of 2018, Hello Games released the fourth major update which included the full multiplayer experience.",

    "description": "Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee is the first chapter of the Oddworld franchise. The game is set in the fictional Oddworld universe inhabited by extraterrestrials. The story follows Abe, a slave on the Mudokon meat factory, who suddenly realizes the perspective of being slaughtered in the near future with all of his fellow slaves. Players are offered to take control of Abe on his way to the liberation of the rest of enslaved Mudokons. The gameplay features classic platformers’ mechanics: all the action is divided into 2D levels that should be passed. In the course of the completion, Abe is going to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles and defeat (or dodge) enemies. Each players’ mistake from failing a grenade throw to falling from high ground will cause death and a restart of the level from the last checkpoint, which means difficulties. On the way through the Oddworld Abe can use his supernatural ability to telepathically influence Sligs (unplayable characters). However, their help is only available in safe areas, so the Mudokons’ rescue is though up to Abe.",

    "description": "Out There Somewhere is where Portal puzzles meet retro platforming. It begins with a scrolling shooter level at which you pilot a spaceship, but the main part of the game is completely different. The player controls the protagonist named Yuri, who crash-landed on an alien planet and is searching for the villainous Grigori who destroyed his ship. Yuri is armed with a portal gun, a device that will teleport the character to where its projectile hits a wall. Unlike in Portal, you can teleport to almost any surface as long as it’s a solid object, the transportation is instant, and there are no lasting “doors”. \nEach level in Out There Somewhere is a small puzzle maze with an exit on the other side, and the player’s goal is to figure out how to get here. Yuri can “shoot himself” across the lava pits toward the other shore, through narrow corridors, or away from the villains. Initially, it is all about reaction, but eventually, the game introduces more complex mechanics, such as laser beams that divert or alter Yuri’s shots, and a regular gun that allows you to fight enemies. Out There Somewhere is stylized as a nostalgic 8-bit NES game with pixel-art graphic and is accompanied by a chiptune soundtrack.",

    "description": "Cinematic gameplay is used to make a stylistic point, and this psychological horror game performs just that. Outlast follows the story of investigative journalist Miles Upshur, that got the lead on the inhuman experiments, performed on the asylum patients. Outlast forces players to run away from danger, simply because there is no combat system. All Miles can do is to document what is happening inside the Mount Massive Asylum. Players do not have a flashlight, only a night vision camera, which constantly requires batteries in order to function. Miles will be pursued through the halls, rooms, yards and enclosed laboratories by distressed and aggressive inhabitants. Over the course of the game, players will have to solve puzzles by locating and collecting items and travel through the Asylum with realistic movement animation and horror sting sound effect, in order to make players sympathize with the protagonists.",

    "description": "Overcooked puts the player into the shoes of two restaurant chefs at once. Each level is a kitchen, and your goal is to cook a list of meals following the onscreen recipes. The time is limited, and there are restrictions on how much money the player can spend on the ingredients. The player controls two characters that can be switched at any time or ordered to do a list of actions. \nThe kitchens are often set in the oddball places, such as a pirate ship, two speeding trucks, a pedestrian crosswalk, or an iceberg. The level elements are dynamic and may move or change during the gameplay. Tables and ovens can slide, and the cooks can fall off the level, though they will respawn shortly. \nThere’s a story mode in which cooking is tied to the plot. The game is set in the Onion Kingdom that was attacked by an insatiable spaghetti monster. The chefs travel back in time to refine their cooking skills and feed the monster when it appears again.\nSince even in the single mode the player has to control two cooks, the game predictably has a co-op multiplayer and a competitive mode in which the players try to “outcook” each other. Both modes, however, are local, and there’s no online multiplayer.",

Overlord had a predecessor, who owned all the lands, but their present rulers defeated and killed him. And they fell into seven deadly sins, one for each.\nThe hero uses the old destroyed tower as a base. He brings there all the trophies and gradually transforms it into a comfortable, spacious and in every respect well-equipped room. Among the trophies are artefacts stolen from the tower, which add even new places to the tower, increase the health and magical power of Overlord.\nMinions are of four kinds, each species has its own abilities. Minions perish in battle, but Overlord can summon new ones from special wells, paying for it with the life force of dead enemies. You can build a smithy and then buy and improve weapons there.\nOverlord can behave differently, he is tempted by the same sins that enslaved his opponents.

    "description": "###The Legacy\nOverwatch is a multiplayer first-person shooter from the company that gave players the saga of Azeroth, Starcraft and the Diablo universe. Despite these releases coming out years ago, they are still alive and actively updated. But the developers at Blizzard wanted something new: the company does not like to experiment with new settings, preferring to transfer existing characters to new genres, worlds, and situations. The exception, perhaps, can only be a game about the three Vikings—The Lost Vikings, but this, too, was a long time ago.\n\n###The story and setting\nAnyway, the company Blizzard has approached the development of Overwatch with team-specific meticulousness to details and desire to create an elaborative game universe. The player faces a choice between 21 characters who were part of the elite Overwatch unit. The task of Overwatch soldiers is to protect the Earth from conflicts and external threats. But something goes wrong, and the team of heroes breaks up. Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar.\n\n###Continuous support\nThe game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins.",

This game is the first part of the PAYDAY series and the beginning of the story of four outlaws – Dallas, Hoxton, Chains and Wolf. The gameplay is about completing 6 different heists throughout America alone (with bots) or in a team (up to 4 members). Each robbery could be carried out in two separate ways: players should decide whether stealth or a breakthrough attack is more suitable and prepare all the ammunition properly in advance. The squad of criminals searching for another “big score” is set up against easy-to-manipulate civilians and powerful police forces, so players are to try their best to prevent the alarm signals and not to face armed resistance. However, if the heavy combat begins, the best option will be to keep shooting countless enemies down till the money is in the bag and the heist is over.",

    "description": "Like original Postal, its sequel was specifically intended to spark controversy. The game is full of gross violence, black humor, obscenities, and biting satire of American life. The plot follows Postal Dude, a typical \"white trash\" and a small town trailer-park dweller, as he is given menial daily tasks, such as buying milk. The way he completes them, however, is what makes Postal 2 one of the most censored and offensive games ever. At the various points of the game, the player may piss over his opponents, use cats as gun silencers (by literally showing your gun up the cat's anus), burn dogs alive, blow up cars (but not drive them, in Postal 2 cars are simply four-wheeled explosives), shoot people and flip them a bird. The game, however, is just as violent as the player wants it to be. Most missions can be accomplished without killing, though it would have spoiled all the fun.\nThe gameplay has changed since the previous part. Isometric view from the original was replaced with the first-person view. The world around Postal Dude is living by itself, regardless of the player’s presence, much like in Grand Theft Auto series. All the town inhabitants are programmed to walk, chat and even fight each other as if they were real people.",

    "description": "Paladins (also known as Paladins: Champions of the Realm) is a free-to-play multiplayer first-person shooter. The game is, according to developers, influenced by Team Fortress 2 and is an example of hero shooter subgenre: a type of multiplayer shooter in which you choose to play as one of the pre-made characters with unique abilities and weapons¬.  \r\nThe primary game mode in Paladins is the siege. Two teams are fighting for the capture point in the center of the map. When a team successfully seizes the capture point, it gets 1 Objective Point, and the Payload spawns for them. Now they must escort the Payload to the enemy’s base to get additional Objective Point. The hostile team can, however, steal the Payload to get Objective Point themselves. Once a team gets 4 Objective Points, it wins the match. \r\nThere are more than 38 heroes (or “champions” as they are called in the game) available in Paladins. Initially, the player has access to 5 of them at any time, and 4 more are in a two-week rotation. To permanently get any other champion, the player has to buy the champion via in-game currency or buy the champions pack for real money.",

    "description": "The creator of the game often travelled through Asia and made the observation that the work of an immigration officer checking documents for entry is simultaneously very monotonous and very responsible. The game reproduces this work - but scammers and unusual situations occur in it much more often than in reality. The task of the player-officer is not to make a mistake, not to let an unwanted guest into the country. He has power, directories, translucent devices, etc., but experienced masters of deception and fraud act against him. The task of the player is complicated by the fact that his country is like all the paranoid dictatorships at the same time. This country fears a lot, seeks to control everything and periodically generates various rules. The game has a lot of humour, a lot of exciting puzzles and unexpected twists, including shooting. The visual and musical design of the game reflects the bizarre world of stupid rules, constant fear and mutual distrust.",

    "description": "The genre of this game is defined as stealth-action. However, its plot is very unusual, although it does not contradict such a definition of the genre.\n\n###Plot\nYour character is a person who is deadly tired of a very common problem: the neighbors who threw a noisy party, not taking into account that they do not live alone in the world.\n\nIn ordinary life, you usually silently endure or call the police. But in this game you should just kill everyone who has the imprudence to make noise. You can do it with a knife, and you can use other, very simple, improvised means. At first, you only have a knife, but over time, the tools appear more interesting.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game has ten unique levels. Some details of each level are generated randomly, so each game is somewhat different from the other.\n\nAfter loading the level of the hero finds himself standing in front of a building or a complex of buildings, where there is a party with the participation of about fifty people.\n\nIt is assumed that by this time your character is already quite angry. And now he faces only one simple task - to destroy all.\n\nThe character has the skills to work with a knife, can set a variety of different traps, use various items.\n\nThere are also obstacles in the game. For example, party members may call the police, there are guards in the building, and if you kill a police officer, FBI agents will arrive. There are also others who may suddenly appear.\n\n###Bonuses\nYour character is not always the same person. There are several characters in the game that you can become as you play. These characters are more capable of killing, among them there are ninja and even a policeman.\n\nYou may have allies, someone you can call for help.\n\nThere is also a spin-off simulation game titled Party Hard Tycoon.",

Without any knowledge who we are or what have we done, players must start to explore an aggressive and cruel fantasy world of criminals, bandits and murderers.

The game was ported to all kinds of consoles, including mobile platforms.\n\nIn Plants vs. Zombies player places on the playing field of tower-plants, which automatically bombard attacking zombies. The main goal is not to let the undead get to the house. The towers are distinguished by their effectiveness against a certain type of enemies and the attack modes. \n\nThe game has several modes: in addition to the usual singleplayer campaign, Adventure Mode is available where a player can earn currency for in-game upgrades. The battle layout also changes throughout the game: it starts on a simple backyard and advances into more complicated night levels and etc.\n\nThe game has a lot of references to the works of popular culture: for example, inscriptions on tombstones are taken from Monty Python's  \"Dead Parrot sketch\".",

    "description": "PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS is battle-royale shooter made only for the multiplayer experience. Players should do their best to become the last one alive. Matches are held on 3 main maps of a large size (Erangel, Miramar, and Sanhok). Each match has 100 participants fighting for themselves. The battle begins with players making the leap out of the plane to spread out across the map and to gather all possible equipment required for survival. Then, after a while, game intelligence randomly sets a circle shape safe zone, which gamers must reach to stay alive, and marks it on the map. Gear and resources are scattered throughout the map, so players can grab everything they need while running to the zone. Therefore, the main action comes out of the players’ collision on their ways to the circle. You can join the fight either alone or in a team (up to 4 people). Due to the customization system, lots of clothing items and weapon skins could be both bought on the marketplace and found in crates. However, in-app purchases don’t actually affect the gameplay.",

According to its owner, it is hidden under a video game store and is kept secret so that if the government outlaws gambling one day, it will know nothing of Inventory. The player does not control any of the characters but is instead an invisible character on its own, who is literally referred to as The Player by other characters. \nAll players have a reserve of $10,000 at the beginning and leave the game if they're left nothing to put at stake. The ultimate goal for the player is to remain the last one sitting behind the table. Sometimes the opponents will put their recognizable belongings, such as Heavy's iconic bazooka Iron Curtain, at stake. This is essentially a board game, however, funny animation and characters' chit-chat filled with references and jokes may keep one interested.\nAchievements in Poker Night at the Inventory allow unblocking certain special features in Team Fortress 2.",

    "description": "Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed by Valve Corporation and released on April 19, 2011 on Steam, PS3 and Xbox 360. It was published by Valve Corporation in digital form and by Electronic Arts in physical form. \n\nIts plot directly follows the first game's, taking place in the Half-Life universe. You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her...\n\nPortal 2's core mechanics are very similar to the first game's ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.\n\nThe game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.\n\nPortal 2 also features a co-op mode where two players take on the roles of robots being led through tests by GladOS, as well as an in-depth level editor.",

While it is technically a reboot of the 2006 game of the same name developed by Human Head Studios, of which the sequel suffered a fall into development hell before the license was sold to Bethesda Softworks, there is no relation between the stories and universes of the two games.\r\n\r\nThe game is set in the near future of an alternate reality. You find yourself stranded on the Talos I space station, invaded by hostile aliens referred to as the Typhon. To survive, you must explore Talos I in search of weapons and resources to fight off the invaders. Along the way, you'll use neural modification devices to learn skills and psychic abilites.\r\n\r\nPrey's gameplay loop takes heavy inspiration from System Shock and Bioshock. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay and its atmosphere. Prey received one paid DLC extension called Mooncrash which introduced a roguelite mode and a free update called Typhon Hunter which introduced a multiplayer mode inspired by classic prop hunt.",

In this mode, you play as a prisoner making their escape causing the most destruction on your way out.

    "description": "New York, Manhattan Peninsula (very detailed), our days. The townspeople are struck by a mutation that turns people into bloodthirsty monsters.\n\nThe protagonist of the game is a seemingly unremarkable young man named Alex Mercer. At the beginning of the game, we know little about him, but it's still more than he knows about himself - Alex does not remember anything, does not even know that he has super abilities.\n\nAbilities are very useful to him, because he will have to stop the epidemic and at the same time hide from the army, police and mercenaries.\n\n###Plot\nAlex comes to the senses in Ghentec's morgue, located in its Manhattan headquarters. Apparently, the reason for his awakening was the noise produced by mercenaries of the organization Blackwatch, trying to break open the doors of this headquarters.\n\nAlex tries to hide, run away. The mercenaries try to stop him, but Alex discovers in himself one by one amazing abilities - he is not harmed by bullets, he can jump high, throw heavy objects, run on the walls of buildings. And he can \"absorb\" people, taking their appearance and gaining knowledge about everything that the absorbed people know and remember. For example, after the takeover of one of the commanders of Blackwatch, Alex finds out that he has a sister.\n\nAlex finds his sister and learns from her (this time without absorption) that he was an important employee of the company, at the headquarters of which we met him at the beginning of the game. Alex's job duties included working with biological weapons.\n\nDuring the game, the army and the police consider Alex guilty of creating and spreading the virus, Blackwatch pursues Alex for other reasons, and Alex himself tries to stop the mutants and other opponents with all the power of their super abilities. Soon it turns out that among these superpowers there is the ability to turn his body into almost anything, including weapons, shield and armor.\n\n###Gameplay\n\nAll of Manhattan from the very beginning of the game is open for the game. Outside of Manhattan, however, you can not get out. The player can follow the story, and can perform separate missions. Due to the presence of super abilities, the hero can move both horizontally and on walls. But not as an insect, but just running. Falling from the height does not hurt Alex, so he can use this trick to defeat opponents - literally falling on their heads.\n  \nAlex can jump very high, and manage to plan in the air.\n\nAlex fights, using the ability of his body to transform. His hands can turn into sledgehammers, blades, whips or shields. He can instantly increase the volume of his body's muscles to increase their strength - in normal mode, such a mass would have prevented him, so he does not wear all these muscles all the time. His skin can be turned into armor. He can also see in the dark and distinguish mutants from normal people by eyes.\n\nAll abilities can also be improved as you progress in the game and perform various tasks.\n\nIn addition to the super powers of the body, the hero uses assault rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, captures infantry combat vehicles, tanks, helicopters and uses their weapons.",

You have to get inside people's mind and help them fight with their fears or memories from the past.\r\n\r\nWe follow a story of Raz, who runs away from the circus and goes to the summer camp for Psychonauts - people with special abilities. They refuse to teach him but allow him to participate in \"Basic Braining\" course. When his talent becomes clear, he's being invited to an experiment. After receiving a vision, he realises that there's a sinister plan behind the camp and only he can save everyone there.\r\n\r\nThe game exists in two different worlds - a real one and a mental one.

The plot is based on the 1980s and 1990s action movie staples and is full of ironic references and quotes from them. You play as a young boxing prodigy whose father was murdered by a stranger. Your goal is to become a great sportsman and win a tournament, but also to investigate and avenge your father’s death. The player controls his character around the clock, making him exercise, eat, go to the job, buy food and other items, and interact with other characters. \nWorking out will improve the boxer’s main characteristics, such as strength and stamina, moving him towards his goal. But there are also essential Sims-like attributes like hunger and happiness that wear down during activities and need to be replenished. Money is also essential and can be earned by performing jobs and quests or by winning boxing matches. Before each fight, be it a match or an assault by a street gang, you choose a number of skills that the boxer will use this time. Completing quests will earn you favors from the other characters that will help you to advance the central plot and find the murderer.",

After getting banished by the society, the main character finds himself all alone. Three exiles soon approach him and invite the protagonist to party with them and nickname him the Reader. The group sets out to cleanse their souls.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe gameplay of Pyre revolves around some sports game, which is connected with a ritual known as the Rites, which happens in a parallel world. The Protagonist controls his three newly found friends in battles against three opponents on a small arena. Each team has its own pyre. Both pyres oppose each other. The objective of the game is to defend your pyre while attacking the enemy one. The player can only destroy the pyre with the orb, that is spawned in the center of the arena and which has to be grabbed and thrown into the pyre.\n\nDuring a round, the Reader can switch between the character he wants to control and pass the orb from one to another. Each player has their own amount of endurance which is required for moving around the arena. If the players of a team come together, they create a zone that is dangerous for the player that carries the orb. If the player with the orb should get into that zone, they'll be temporarily removed from the game.\n\nWhile free from the Rites, the player can travel through the world of Pyre, train his teammates or try to learn more about the Rites.",

For the first time in the series, the so-called champions appear in the game. Each champion has a different amount of health, top speed and a unique ability that can be used once in 20-45 seconds depending on the champion and needs to be recharged after usage. The abilities are designed using the rock-paper-scissors principle with each ability serving as a counter to another. This was done in order to put emphasis on a player's skill and not the chosen character. The game also features character customization system which allows changing the look of any selected champion.\n\nThere is no loadout system in the game whatsoever. Players have to pick up the weapons scattered on the map.\n\nPlayers can download the game for free, yet they will have access to only one Champion, Ranger. The players have to either rent new champions using the in-game currency or by the so-called champions pack that will unlock every in-game character for an unlimited amount of time.",

    "description": "In Race the Sun you control a spaceship powered by solar energy. You have to dodge objects on your way, for example, from laser beams, other ships and various obstacles, while collecting blue pyramids that will boost the player. The game will end only when you either crash into something, die, or when the sun goes down. The ship's speed remains constant until the ship remains under direct sunlight, but if the ship falls into shadow or collides with an object, the ship's speed will drop.\n\nYou have to fly through the landscape with abstract shapes and obstacles of varying complexity. Levels are procedurally generated and divided into separate regions, and each contains its own set of tests.\n\nThe game presents three primary levels: the standard level, the level of \"Apocalypse\", in which the player moves faster through more difficult tests, and an obstacle course in the form of a maze. These regions and levels change daily for all players, and the online scoreboard allows users to compare their results with others.",

    "description": "RAGE 2 is the second installment in the RAGE series of post-apocalyptic action games. It is inspired by the Mad Max movie series.\r\n\r\n###Plot and setting\r\nThe game is set in 2165, thirty years after the events of the original Rage. More than a century before that, the Apophis asteroid fell on Earth, causing mass destruction and driving humanity to near-extinction. The few remaining people hide in the few safe oases, while the rest of the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland raided by gangsters and evil mutants. The main protagonist is a man named Walker, who is the last ranger of the wasteland and a wielder of superhuman powers. He fights against the totalitarian organization called The Authority.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nLike in the original RAGE, the sequel emphasizes its over-the-top action. The player controls Walker from the first person view and uses his huge guns and other weapons to fight monsters. The protagonist can also drive any vehicle that can be found in the game and engage in vehicular battles. When the player is driving, the game switches to the third person view. A new feature introduced in RAGE 2 is its Overdrive system that encourages aggressive playing style. By killing multiple enemies in a short amount of time, the player can enter Overdrive mode, which increases the guns' power and the amount of loot. There is also a multiplayer mode.",

    "description": "Red Dead Redemption is a third-person open-world adventure game which implements the Wild West at its best: it is very much GTA-clone but in bizarre stylistics and the very beginning of the twentieth century. This is the second title of a franchise, being preceded by Red Dead Revolver and followed by Red Dead Redemption 2 coming out in late 2018. \nWe play as John Marston who gradually takes down and take out criminals and those, who crosses his path. Among the combat mechanics, the most interesting one is \"Dead Eye\" — it allows one to point multiple targets out in slow motion and then shoot them simultaneously. \nThe game features 16-players multiplayer and cooperative and also has zombie DLC — Undead Nightmare. Additional content adds two modes to the original game: undead overrun in which you have to survive an infinite amount of zombie waves, and Land Grab in which player has to defend the particular piece of land to gain control of it.",

    "description": "Resident Evil 2 is the remake of the 1998 game of the same name. \n\n###Plot\nThe plot of the remake is identical to that of the original game. The story follows the survivors of a zombie virus outbreak in the fictional Raccoon City. There are two protagonists: Claire Redfield, a high school student, and Leon Kennedy, a policeman. They both search for the ways to escape the infested city. Companions, such as Ada Wong and Sherry, occasionally follow the protagonists. The characters eventually uncover the dark secrets of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus as a biological weapon, and fight its monsters, such as the Tyrant.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player controls either Leon or Claire from the third person view in a 3D environment. The two protagonists' storylines are intertwined. The player can complete the scenario playing one of the protagonists, and then replay it from the other character's POV, with all his previous actions taken into account. The game combines puzzle solving with zombie fights. Both protagonists use firearms as their main weapon; however, ammo is scarce.\n\n###Changes from the original\nBesides the updated graphics, the remake features a new camera and controls. In the original game, the controls were relative to the position of the player's character rather than the camera. The remake uses an over the shoulder camera, and the movements are relative to its angle. There's also no more loading screens, and the characters move between locations seamlessly.",

    "description": "Resident Evil 4 is a third-person shooter game developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and published by Capcom. The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president's daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.\nDevelopment began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.\nResident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the \"over-the-shoulder\" third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.\n\n#Gameplay\nThe player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.\nResident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a \"finishing move\" on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game's many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.\nThe main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (\"The Cattle\" in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.\nThe inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.\nCapcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is \"Separate Ways\", a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong's involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series' villain Albert Wesker. \"Ada's Report\", a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada's relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames \"The Mercenaries\" and \"Assignment Ada\" (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.\n\n#Plot\nU.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President's daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.\nWhile in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a \"sample\" once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.\nAfter killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler's henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar's traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley's infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon's hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser's fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.",

This is the fifth main installment in Capcom’s acclaimed franchise Resident Evil.  \r\nThe story follows Chris Redfield, the protagonist of the original Resident Evil, and his partner Sheva Alomar. As the members of the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, they are tasked to intercept an illegal bioweapon trade in Kijuju, Africa. Upon arrival, they find out that Kijuju is infected by Las Plagas, parasites that turn its carriers into zombie-like creatures.   \r\nThe game is notable for being a departure from the series survival horror roots towards more action-oriented gameplay style. The other significant innovation in the series brought with Resident Evil 5 is cooperative multiplayer for two players. There are many situations during the game that requires two players cooperation therefore if in singleplayer the second characters is controlled by AI.",

    "description": "Resident Evil 7: Biohazard is the latest installment in the Resident Evil series. For 13 long years, Resident Evil series were rejecting the survival-horror aspect and atmosphere of first original games in the series mainly released in nineties on PlayStation one system. From the famous Resident Evil 4 until Resident Evil 6, the series went full-force into action genre leaving horror elements behind and hard-core fans disappointed. Finally, Capcom realized that Resident Evil needs a change and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard delivers those changes at its fullest. First of all, the camera angle changed from over the shoulder view into first-person mode. Another change is that survival-horror elements are back together with light puzzle solving, inventory management and maze-like mansion in which the main story of the game happens. The player controls Ethan Winters who is searching for his lost wife in a dark mansion filled with horrible creatures and insane family. \r\nResident Evil 7: Biohazard can also be played with virtual reality setup and it’s known as one of the best games which supports VR.",

    "description": "In 1802, the merchant ship \"Obra Dinn\" set out from London for the Orient with over 200 tons of trade goods. Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea.  \r\n \r\nEarly this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port with sails damaged and no visible crew. As insurance adjustor for the East India Company's London Office, find means to board the ship and recover the Crew Muster Roll book for assessment.\r\n\r\n(\"Obra\" is pronounced like \"Cobra\" without the C).\r\n\r\nFrom the author:\r\n\r\nGoals\r\n\r\nI want to challenge myself so this'll be a very different game from anything I've done before, including Papers Please. There'll be less creativity with the gameplay and instead I want to experiment with the rendering, story, and a few technical features. Right now I have only a rough idea about the narrative. I'm hoping to capture a compelling mystery with suspense and twists in the limited space of an old merchant sailing ship. It won't be the typical \"collect items and look for clues\" structure. There's a slightly cool gameplay hook but I won't go into details on that until much later.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevlog\r\n\r\nI'll try to keep this (https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.0) devlog lively as I make progress. Because the gameplay itself is more standard, there probably won't be as many creative updates as the Papers Please devlog. I will post lots of pictures and builds as soon as I'm able. Things will likely also move slower than Papers Please did too, at least at the start. P,P still takes a good amount of my time so there's less chance for me to maintain a laser-like focus on one project like last time. The lower bound for finishing this game is around 3 months but realistically I think it'll take me around half a year. My Maya skills are pretty rusty so I expect the modeling/animation to take the most time.\r\n\r\n\r\n1-bit Rendering\r\n\r\nMy first computer was a Mac Plus. I've always had a nostalgia-softened spot in my heart for 1-bit graphics. I'd like to capture the detailed black & white look of old Mac games in a realtime 1st person game. I plan to push it grittier and less cartoon-like than those old games; the hard part will be keeping everything legible without it becoming an unreadable mess of dithered pixels. One interesting problem with 1-bit rendering is that it doesn't scale well for images and it compresses to video like shit - so YouTube stuff may look really poor. We'll see how it goes.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnity 3D\r\n\r\nI'm gonna use Unity for this one. I fell in love with Haxe/OpenFL on my last project but unfortunately the 3D situation is not that great there yet. Also, it's time to finally see why 90% of the indie scene is using Unity. I have a good amount of experience with 3D games and the few days I've played around with Unity so far have been pretty productive. The animated title screen scene up there (with post-processing shaders and all) was created in one day. I now have unrealistically high hopes.",

    "description": "The second installment of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise is set one year before the events of Shadow of Chernobyl and serves as its prequel. You will explore the forbidden area around Chernobyl, Ukraine, after a new disaster that turned into The Zone, a post-apocalyptic wasteland full of mutants. The setting was inspired by a Russian sci-fi book Roadside Picnic and its adaptation Stalker. Scar, the main character of Clear Sky, is a stalker, which in this world is a term for guides and explorers in The Zone. He was hit by an energy beam that gave him a superhuman ability to survive The Zone’s phenomena. Scar joins the Clear Sky, a secret science organization that studies The Zone’s anomalies. Strelok, an important character from the previous game, appears as the main antagonist. \nLike its predecessor, Clear Sky is a combination of first-person shooter gameplay with RPG mechanics like skills, leveling up, dialogue, and inventory. The player is free to explore the open world and accept quests unrelated to the central plot from various NPCs and factions. Compared to Shadow of Chernobyl, the prequel has improved graphics, additional options for customization and equipment repair and a complete day/night cycle.",

    "description": "This post-apocalyptic game that spawned the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise is inspired by (but not really based on) the 'Roadside Picnic' novel by brothers Strugatsky and Tarkovsky's movie 'Stalker', borrowing some of the terms and aesthetics from both. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is set in Ukraine, in the infamous Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Several parts of the open-world setting were modeled after the real Chernobyl surroundings, including the power plant and the city of Pripyat, although designers took some liberties. The bleak environment and dark ambient music help to create an unsettling atmosphere of this place. \nAccording to the backstory, in 2006, the second Chernobyl disaster occurred, turning the surrounding area into post-apocalyptic ruins, full of grotesque mutants and time-space anomalies. The \"stalkers\" in this world are the explorers who wander The Zone in search of valuable loot. You play as the Marked One, a stalker who lost his memory. All that remains of his past is a memo that says “Kill Strelok”. The Marked One will have to learn more about himself, Strelok, The Zone, and its mysteries. The plot is non-linear, and there are multiple endings that depend on the quests you completed earlier.",

Trying to figure out what’s going on, Simon finds Catherine Chun, a scientist, who tells him about the technology of copying the human personality.\nThe gameplay is based on exploration and puzzle solving. There's no combat, and you are meant to avoid enemies and act stealthily. To progress through the story, you need to search for clues, read multiple notes and solve puzzles.   \nThough there are monsters in SOMA, it frightens with its atmosphere in the first place. A dark, abandoned station with dead people, uncertainty and the lack of any understanding of what is waiting for you is scarier than screamers and blood rivers. Moral choices you have to make don’t affect the story much: instead, they change your attitude to the events, so it’s you who develops through the game.",

    "description": "SUPERHOT is an artistically minimalistic first-person shooter. The key feature of the project is its time mechanics. If you don’t move the action slows down so you can think over your next steps. This feature brings together shooters and strategies, making SUPERHOT a mix of these genres.\nThe story follows the concept of a \"game inside a game.\" It starts with your friend who sends you a game you definitely need to try. But the further you go, the more you realize there's somebody except you in the game, who wants you to stop playing. So you progress through similar levels killing enemies and trying to figure out what's happening. \nBesides original time mechanics, the game makes you quite vulnerable: a single enemy shot kills you making start the level again. At the same time your weaponry is limited, so to survive you need to pick enemies' guns and ammo or use melee combat. Additional to the campaign mode, there's the endless one and the challenge to make levels more difficult.",

The goal is to overcome the evil syndicate using well-designed tactics.\nExcept for missions, the game pays attention to the technology development and resource management you need to provide to defeat Dracogenics.

The ability to summon any imaginable item gives you an almost unlimited number of ways you can solve any puzzle.\nScribblenauts Unlimited features a way more detailed plot than its predecessors. There's an extensive backstory that explains the protagonist's motivation in gathering Starites. We learn that Max and his sister Lily played pranks on people using their magic notebook until it got them into trouble. One day they unknowingly played a trick against an old wizard. He grew angry and magically turned Lily into stone. Max can only save his sister by gathering enough Starites. Unlike previous parts, this game is set in an open, albeit cartoonish, world, that gradually opens to you as you gather more Starites. The tasks are now assigned by the NPCs, and Starites are given as a reward for help. Thus, they serve as the proof that Max has corrected his behavior.",

Both navigation and combat happen in the same environment.\r\nUnshackled traversal -  Swim, climb, vault, jump off or hoist up ledges as you run through the world with a navigation system based on platformer expertise that breaks free from the classic bound-to-the-grid tileset movement.\r\nPrequel story set in The Messenger’s universe - Dozens of original characters and story arcs will take you on a captivating journey. Sometimes epic, sometimes silly, and other times emotional, Sea of Stars does its RPG duty of exploring classic themes of adventure and friendship, while also being chock-full of the unexpected twists and events you’d expect from a Sabotage production.\r\nFull-on dynamic lighting - Our custom-made render pipeline allows the creation of a breathtaking world coming to life by pushing the limits of 2D pixel-art games.\r\nThe Sabotage treatment on the turn-based RPG genre - Every system has been deeply analyzed to create an experience that pays respect to retro classics, while reworking some elements to offer a modernized experience free of irritants and timesinks.",

In Dragonfall, you control a team of shadowrunners, led by your protagonist, in an isometric view. While hacking a data vault in Berlin, your party discovers dangerous secrets that were better left unknown. The characters in your team are highly developed, have backstories and inspire sympathy. To avoid losing your favorite companion, you will have to plan your battles prudently.\nDragonfall was originally a DLC released to support the previous part, Shadowrun Returns. Compared to the standard edition, \"Director's Cut\" includes five additional missions, several alternate endings, an improved interface design, a slightly different combat system and a new soundtrack composed by Jon Everist.",

All the traditional victory types are in place, and a new one, religious, is introduced.\n\nA distinct new feature in the sixth part is that city improvements are no more concentrated in each city's only main tile. Instead, they are distributed throughout its whole surrounding area. Each of them is now considered a \"district\" with a specific purpose, and some of them should be built only on specific terrain. Similarly, wonders now occupy tiles on their own. Technology tree was also modified to take into account the player's terrain improvements that may speed up the research of certain technologies. Cultural achievements, such as Opera or Drama, are no more considered \"technologies\" and form a separate Civics research tree instead. Also, unlike most of its predecessors, Civilization VI allows stacking similar types of military units.",

It is also a strategy set in space with the science-fiction lore.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe point of the game is to conquer as many planets as possible using the given resources. The protagonist can be chosen out of three races: industrials, aliens and psychics each with unique special abilities.\nThe gameplay process occurs exclusively in online mode, but single battles and succeeds against enemy AI is possible too. However, the campaign as a whole cannot be played offline. \n\n###Key features\nAs in usual RTS, the gameplay is centered around resource management — the title's economy consists of prices on Metal, Credits, and Crystal — each with the individual gain conditions. So it would be impossible for instance to sell all of your metal to the friendly guild — after the wholesale, stock prices decrease and economy shifts towards them like real-life one.\nWhile exploring the world, the player may stumble across habitable planets and anomalies which prevent the player from getting to the goal. Anomalies include asteroids, hostile environment, and ice fields.\n\n###Rebellion DLC\nThe expansion adds two new units into the gams: Loyalist and Rebel — delegates of any races can choose between them. A graphical engine was updated as well.",

    "description": "Skullgirls is a fighting game developed by Lab Zero and primarily published by Marvelous and Autumn Games. Since its initial release in 2012, it has received two free extensions, Skullgirls Encore and Skullgirls 2nd Encore and while its roster initially consisted of an all-female cast of 8 characters, 6 more characters were added, 5 being developed thanks to the game's Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, including 2 male characters. At its release, Skullgirls was developed by Reverge Labs, but the team that created the game split off from the company to form Lab Zero. In Japan, the game is published by Arc System Works. On Nintendo Switch, the game is published by Skybound Games.\n\nSkullgirls takes place in the Canopy Kingdom, inspired by 1940s America, in which corruption and conflict runs rampant. Once every seven years, an artifact called the Skull Heart appears, granting the wish of one woman. However, if the Skull Heart is used by a woman with impure intentions, it will control her, turning her into a destructive monster called the Skullgirl. Not once has anyone used the Skull Heart without falling to its curse. The game follows the stories of 14 characters on their way to face the Skullgirl and retrieve the Heart, be it for the greater good or simply their own gain.\n\nThe game is a tribute to Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and its mechanics are intended as a more polished version of the classic fighting game title, with some original ideas. In a standard player vs. player match, each player controls one character out a chosen number of one to three characters which they can switch to at any time. They can also call their inactive characters to perform assist attacks. Like most Marvel vs. Capcom-inspired games, Skullgirls is fast-paced and features long, complex combos based on animation cancels. It introduces a burst system which allows players to break their opponent's combo if it becomes too long.\n\nSkullgirls features a 'dark deco'-inspired art style mixed with some horror themes and a jazz and rock soundtrack consisting of 28 tracks. In 2013, the game set the Guinness World Record Gamer's Edition record for most average frames of animation per character in a video game, reaching 1,439 frames per character and 11,515 frames total for its initial eight-character roster.\n\nIn February 2013, Skullgirls came in second in a crowdfunding event organized by fighting game website Shoryuken to decide what would be the final game featured on the EVO 2013 line up, with all proceeds sent to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Skullgirls raised over $US 78,000. While it was not featured as an EVO main game, EVO organizers supported the game's side event by providing prize money and advertisement.",

    "description": "Sleeping Dogs is a third-person action shooter with RPG elements, having Hong Kong as its central location. The city is an open world for the player’s exploration, and many gameplay features revolve around interacting with the surroundings. A huge aspect of immersion would be music, as it is themed according to the geographical location of the city.\nThe main character Wei Shen finds himself in various situations which lead to the development of the main story. Resolving conflicts between local citizens and Hong Kong’s organized crime, the protagonist is offered to join one of the city’s gangs. Due to this, the players need to plan their actions carefully, building trust among both the gangsters and the police. \nThe game features an unlock-based role-playing system, where every consecutive ability or trait is unlocked after the player achieves a specific goal or levels up character’s prestige in each of the three in-game groups. The combat system is heavily reliant on the character’s skill of martial arts, but conventional weaponry is also a favorable choice. Non-story related interactions add flavor to the overall gameplay, as there is a wide choice of how to spend the protagonist’s free time.",

    "description": "In the far-distant future, far, far away in space (to be exact, a thousand light-years from the Earth), on the planet Far, Far Range, mega-corporations (they, it turns out, will be with us in the distant future!) discovered the ideal source of income, universal natural resource - Plort.\n\nYou can produce almost anything from Plot - from food and household chemicals, to solid alloys and incredibly powerful batteries.\n\nPlort is a concentrated mucus produced by slimes - jelly-like living organisms of various species and characteristics.\n\nSlimes, unfortunately, can not be taken to Earth to breed and receive the right amount of Plort. We have to fly to 'Far, Far Range', to build there something like a ranch for slimes and for all this to hire earthlings. One of these earthlings, the space rancheros, the brave young girl Beatrix LeBeau is the character of the game. The girl (and the player) will fly a thousand light-years in a deep sleep to equip a ranch from a Hobson Twillgers, study the planet's environment, collect, feed and breed slimes.\n\nTo get the necessary hints the girl can look for notes of the former owner - they meet on the territory of the ranch, and also communicate via Star Mail with a close friend from the Earth. In conversations with a friend, we learn a lot of things about the former, earthly life of the heroine - this information will be important.\n\n###Gameplay and economics\nSlimes need to be fed, and this is important. The rest they will do themselves.\nIt is necessary to feed them not by anything, but by appropriate products. But slimes will produce a lot of Plort - and Plort can be sold on the market, having received currency - newbucks. For newbucks you can buy equipment for ranches and so on. The world of the game is not known until the end, it is possible and necessary to travel through it, opening up new locations, finding new slimes for the ranch, as well as food for slimes and other new resources.\n\nFrom different types of slimes you can get hybrids. However, with this you need to be more careful - you can get aggressive evil slimes, which will have to be dissolved with water.\n\nSlimes are quite diverse. Ordinary slimes are generally friendly, but they can be dangerous not because of evil will, but because of some natural features like thorns, emitted radiation or the ability to explode.\n\nSome slimes are more productive than others, they produce more Plort. It is these slimes that are created by hybridization, since it is difficult to find them in a natural environment.\n\nOrdinary slimes sometimes merge into a huge Gordo-slime - inside such organisms there are often valuable resources and other interesting and useful things. To get all this, you need to blow up the Gordo-slime.\n\n###Game modes\nAdventure. The world is open for research, there are no serious restrictions. You can develop as you want. You can communicate with other ranchers, carry out their assignments and exchange resources with them. \n\nCarefree is an adventure mode that goes even easier.\n\nThe five-day trial is a mode in which you need to earn as many newbucks as possible in 5 days.\n\n\"The steel master of the ranch\" - the conditions in this mode are so complicated that it resembles a game of survival. In the mode there are unique tests that change the impression of the game.",

The blue hedgehog is attacked by a new enemy called Time Eater, who tries to change the past to help Dr. Robotnik. Time Eater kidnaps Sonic’s friends and imprisons them in the various eras of the past. Sonic has to travel back in time to meet the original Sonic and Tails from the 16 bit game series. Old and new versions of characters team up to defeat Time Eater and Robotnik and restore the space-time continuum. \nSonic will have to revisit the levels from his old games. Each zone is split into “Classic” 2D levels from Sega Genesis and Dreamcast eras, and their “Modern” 3D counterparts from the 2000s. Sonics from the different eras also have their unique abilities, and there’s the Skill Shop, where the characters can obtain new skills. Each zone includes two boss fights and a Doppelganger Race, which is a time trial. When they're not on the levels, the Sonics reside in the White Zone, an open world that serves as a hub to access the regular zones. \nSonic Generations includes a lot of unlockable content, such as music, art, special skills and, in some versions, even the original 1991 Sonic the Hedgehog game.",

This installment serves as a reboot of the Soulcalibur series.\n\n###Plot\nThe plot retells the events that happened before and during the original Soulcalibur and alters them, thus creating a new timeline for the franchise. The events of the game are set between 1583 and 1590. As with the original, the story is based around the conflict between two magical swords, the evil Soul Edge that devours souls and Soul Calibur, the spiritual sword, and their respective wielders. The Soul Edge belonged to a dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon until a brave knight named Siegfried challenged him.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe game is meant to attract new players to the series, and some of the changes were made for that goal. For example, the game introduces Reversal Edge mechanic, in which two opponents enter a slow-mo scene and exchange blows in a rock-paper-scissors manner by pushing a single button. This option allows even the novice players to counter most types of attacks. There's also a new Lethal Hit mechanic which allows the players to knock the opponent down by performing moves in the right time.\n\n###Characters\nThe game includes most of the popular characters of the series, such as Mitsurugi, Siegfried, Sophitia, and Cervantes de Leon. Some of the characters are redesigned. Geralt, the famous protagonist of The Witcher series, appears as a playable guest character.",

    "description": "South Park: The Stick of Truth is an action RPG based on the American animated series South Park. Players assume the role of the New Kid, who moved to eponymous fictional town in Colorado State with his parents. According to the storyline, the New Kid meets the army of humans led by Wizard King Cartman in the Kupa Keep Kingdom (Cartman’s backyard) and gets his nickname Douchebag. Cartman, as well as other characters of the original series, introduce The Stick of Truth, the key to the war between humans and elves, to the New Kid. Once The Stick is stolen by elves, the war and the whole adventure of Douchebag begins. The game is viewed from the third-person perspective. To start the campaign, players have to choose one of the character types (Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Jew), each with its own parameters and special abilities. Completing the levels and eliminating the enemies gives experience points that could be spent on learning new skills or upgrading the level. The gameplay also features fast travel ability. Remarkable characters of the original series – Cartman, Butters, Stan, and Kyle – join the protagonist during his wild adventure.",

Following the worst recorded sandstorms in Dubai, Captain Martin Walker was sent to investigate the events that took place in the city, after it was cut off from all transport and communication. So now the squad of the elite soldiers has to discover, what was meant by the last message they received from the dense wall of raging sand.\nSpec Ops: The Line places the attention on the squad mechanics, where players can give orders to the NPCs, accompanying the player during the game. Aside from the single-player story campaign, players can join the multiplayer matches, which may vary from the solo/team deathmatch to “King of the Hill” type matches. Cooperative missions for two players have been added shortly after the game release. The single player campaign allows players to experiment with the weapons, carrying two at a time and use the environments to their advantage, using hazardous sandstorm to clear-out the enemies.",

Meanwhile, Peter is working for the scientist Otto Octavius, who didn't yet become Dr. Octopus, on their science project. Throughout the game, Spidey has to deal with multiple enemies, such as Norman Osbourne, Electro, Vulture, Rhino and Kingpin, among others.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe player controls Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, from the third person view. There are also sections of the game in which the player controls other protagonists, namely Mary Jane and Miles Morales. The game is set in a 3D environment that is modeled after New York City. The player can travel the city using web slings, running, jumping, and crawling the walls. The setting includes numerous high-rise buildings designed specifically for Spider-Man's movements.\r\n\r\nAs the player progresses, he or she unlocks new suits that grant Spider-Man new abilities, such as additional attacks or enhanced Spider-Sense. The abilities are not tied to the suits, however, and the player can use the suit of his or her choice without losing the ability. The combat system is similar to that in Batman: Arkham, in that Spider-Man fights many opponents in hand-to-hand combat but avoids killing them.",

    "description": "The game takes place in the world of the epic \"Star Wars\".\r\nWhen creating a character, first select a class - Soldier, Scoundrel or Scout. Classes differ in the proportion of strength, health and cunning. Later, three more classes will open, each of which will be a Jedi: Jedi Guardian, Jedi Consular, and Jedi Sentinel. This will also be the choice in favour of different proportions of strength, intelligence and skills.\r\nIn the world of \"Star Wars,\" there is a Force that can be vested both by the Jedi and by their enemies. There are Force Powers of three types: light, dark and neutral. They should be studied, this raises the level of skill. Forces are expended but are restored.\r\nThe player can alternately lean toward both the Light and the Dark Side of the Force - this will affect the ending of the game and the use of Force Powers. For example, if the character belongs to the Light Side, then the use of the Dark Force will require more of this Force from him than using the Light.\r\nThe hero will visit the underground metropolis, the desert planet, the planet-forest and the planet-ocean, caves with crystals for light swords, sand Tatooine, the planet-cemetery, space ships and stations.\r\nThe hero will interact with sentient beings, droids of different classes and exotic animals.",

The game begins on the ship \"The Endar Spire \", attacked by the Sith fleet near the planet Taris. Player and one of the pilots, Carth Onasi, descend on the planet in an escape pod. Their primary goal is to find a Jedi named Bastila Shan, who commanded their ship. She has the mastery of battle meditation, by which the Republic has managed so far to withstand the onslaught of the Sith.\r\n\r\nKnights of the Old Republic is the first computer game, which takes place in the author's world of Star Wars. Battles go through in real time, but they can be suspended at any time. The main character balances between good and evil, and each of his actions depends on his belonging to the Light or Dark sides of the Force, and ultimately the ending of the game.\r\n\r\nIn place of magic came the Force Powers that is vested in the Jedi, and they are divided into three categories: light, dark and neutral. Any Jedi can study any force that is sufficient for his level.",

Unlike many similar games of this genre, Starbound has a story you need to follow. Playing as a space officer whose planet was destroyed by aliens, you explore the universe and prepare for the revenge.\nIn general, Starbound is a typical 2D sandbox with such activities as spelunking, crafting and exploring that are united with story missions. Quests help to find the information about the in-game universe and races and lead through different tasks. Some levels are based on platforming only, while the others make you change the environment and solve puzzles. Some of them are based on the character’s ability to turn into a ball and use both hands to hold tools.\nAnd still, the key feature of Starbound is procedurally generated levels and their design. The game features a huge amount of planets to explore, with multiple caves, buildings, labyrinths, and forests.",

But now one brave clone learned his real purpose and is going to escape to freedom. \nGameplay in Stealth Inc. 2 is centered around stealth action, for which the game was even compared to the Splinter Cell series despite huge stylistic differences. The clone has to move swiftly and silently to avoid security cameras and sentry robots. Its time is limited, however, and the player has to find the balance between speed and safety. Level design in Stealth Inc. 2 reminds of Metroidvania-style platformers. The factory is split into areas, consisting of eight test chambers each, all of them interconnected in the manner called overworld. The player will have to solve puzzles to open new areas. Every area introduces a gadget that should be equipped and is essential to use to move forward. Some of the puzzles are deadly traps that are only solved through trial and error. On the first walkthrough, they will almost inevitably kill the clone and send it back to the checkpoint.",

    "description": "Street Fighter V is a fighting game, the fifth main installment in Capcom’s Street Fighter series.  \n\n###Story \nThe game takes place between the events of Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter III. The game features two story-oriented modes: Character Story and A Shadow Falls. In Character Story you can choose any character to go through a series of fights. It starts with a prologue and finishes with ending unique for each character. At launch only, Characters Story was available while A Shadow Falls, a full-fledged story mode that describes a battle between World Fighters and criminal syndicate Shandaloo was added later in July 2016.\n  \n###Gameplay \nLike its predecessors, Street Fighter is a 2D one-on-one fighting game. The initial characters roster included 16 characters four of which were newcomers to the series. Since the game release, many more characters were added with DLC making roster more than twice as big as it was on launch. The core gameplay shares many similarities with Street Fighter IV. However, it abandons Focus Mode and Ultra Combos introduce in that game. The main new mechanic in Street Fighter V is V-Skills system. V-Skill is special moves, unique for every character. Using these moves helps to fill V-Gauge which can be used to perform V-Reversals, special counter-attacks, or V-Trigger especially powerful abilities that require the full gauge.",

    "description": "Streets of Rage, known as Bare Knuckle (ベア・ナックル Bea Nakkuru) in Japan, is a trilogy of beat 'em up games developed and published by SEGA in the 1990s.\n\nFamously known for its non stop action and electronic dance influenced music - scored by Yuzo Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima - the series has gained the status of cult classic throughout the years. It is considered one of the best beat 'em up series of all time. After many years, Axel and Blaze are finally picking up the fight where they left.\n\nFeaturing hand-drawn visuals from the team behind 2017’s gorgeous Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap remake, Streets of Rage 4 builds upon the classic trilogy’s gameplay with new mechanics, a fresh story and a gauntlet of dangerous stages with a serious crime problem. Streets of Rage 4 recalls classic gameplay but it stands as an entirely original arcade-style romp thanks to the expertise of Guard Crush Games and Dotemu.\n\nWhether players gang up with a friend or clean up the city solo, Streets of Rage 4 is a skull-bashing, chicken-chomping delight all set to a thumping soundtrack sure to get your blood pumping.",

You control Ryley Robinson, a space traveler in the 22nd century, who crash-landed his starship on a planet that is covered almost entirely by the ocean. The protagonist needs to eat and drink, although this can be disabled in lower difficulty modes. He can desalinate oceanic water, catch or gather the seafood, and create useful tools and structures. Unlike many survival games, Subnautica has a detailed plot, in which Ryley has to uncover why his ship crashed. By exploring the ocean, finding the remnants of other crashes, and listening to the radio messages, Robinson will learn about the enormous Leviathan, the mysterious Precursors, and the reason why this planet is quarantined.\r\nThe game is famous for its spectacular portrayal of the ocean and its wildlife. Robinson is equipped with a scuba diving gear that allows the player to spend most of the game underwater, although oxygen still has to be replenished. The player can dive deep and explore the world full of corals, fish, and other colorful sea creatures, often grotesque or bio-luminescent. The environment is randomly generated to improve replayability.",

Famous for its controls, Surgeon Simulator literally gives you the ability to control your virtual left hand’s fingers with A, W, E, R and Space buttons on your keyboard. The mouse is used to move your hand up and down.\nAs these controls aren't easy to master, it's quite hard to carry on the first operations. But the game starts to challenge you from the beginning, offering to operate a patient's heart, brains, and other important organs. The game's physics model reacts on every mistake you make with blood rivers and a patient's death. Because of this Surgeon Simulator became a meme among gamers with videos of its playthroughs gaining thousands of views.",

    "description": "Syberia is an adventure game where a twisted story is combined with puzzle solving and a graphical quest’s elements. You take on the role of Kate Walker, who has to travel over half of Europe to fix her business issues. However, her adventure appears to be exciting and surreal, and, actually, life-changing. Searching for a man to sell her a toy factory, Kate becomes involved in a fantastic journey that leads her to the land of Syberia where mammoths are still alive.\nThe main gameplay activity is classical for point-and-click quests and for the most part is solving numerous complicated puzzles that are tightly connected with the plot development and extend and deepen the story. Huge locations may contain dozens of puzzles, so finding all clues will make you explore every corner of every place. Puzzles often feature work with details from mechanisms and odd inventions. The gameplay supports the surreal atmosphere of the game which twists the reality with human dreams and hopes.\nSyberia is followed by two sequels, Syberia II and Syberia 3, that continue the adventures of Kate Walker.",

It is the ninth installment in the series.\n\n###Plot\nAn unnamed journalist investigates the Mishima family history after his family got killed in a war that was started by Jin Kazama. In his investigation, the journalist tries to find out why did Jin's grandfather kill his own wife and threw his son Kazuya down the cliff. At the same time, Jin goes into hiding after defeating an ancient demon named Azazel while his grandfather takes over Mishima Zaibatsu. The world war goes on.\n\n###Gameplay\nJust like the previous games in the series (apart from Tekken Tag Tournament 1 & 2), Tekken 7's gameplay revolves around one-on-one hand-to-hand fights. \n\nPlayers are free to choose one of 43 playable characters. Every character has their own personal list of attacks and combos and drastically differs in play style.\n\nSeveral new additions were made to the game's combat system. Players can now use devastating hits that will take from 40 to 80 percent of the enemy's health if the player's health drops too low. Moreover, the players are able to use a Rage Drive. It allows for performing a special hit on a high speed that inflicts major damage to the enemy. The last new addition is Power Crush. This feature lets the players attack their opponent even when they're under attack. Players can't block their enemies low kicks while using the Power Crush.",

    "description": "###Mods and Kickstarter\nA unique set of digitized board games from the Berserk Games studio. The studio successfully raised funds for development in 2014 at Kickstarter and released the project in the same year. Only two people worked on the game: they just graduated from college and had some experience developing game mods. The game uses the Unity graphics engine and is available on Steam for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and OS X.\n\n###Game mechanics\nThere are no conditions for victory or defeat in the game. Each time players simply spawn on the playing field, where they can interact freely with game figures and pieces. All the craziness occurs within the realistic physical model, which the developers have added for greater similarity to the real prototypes. In addition to the insanity that can be arranged in multiplayer along with ten other players, the game engine supports the ability to use preset rules for different board games and thus play them.\n\n###Key features\nThere are several games included. For example, chess, poker, and checkers. The set is small, but the game supports Steam Workshop and the ability to download your own models of figures and game boards. Thus, players added to the standard set of three games three thousand more variations, most of which are variations on games, for the inclusion of which developers will have to purchase a license.",

    "description": "The game takes place in a Viking world inhabited by three races (humans, Varls, and Dredges) created by different gods. Once between people and Varls was hostility, but with the emergence of dredges, they were forced to unite forces, for not being killed by them. At the beginning of the game in the world reigns eternal winter; the gods left all races, and the sun stopped, it would seem, forever.\r\n\r\nThe story begins with Ubin, who arrived in the port city Strand for an annual tribute. Upon arrival in the town, he learns that some bandits want to capture the authority. He's moving to the Town Tall to help the Governor deal with them. Soon, a squad of Prince Vognir and Prince Ludin arrive in the Strand. In the next morning, Ubin joins the team of Vognir, and they are all going in Grofheim\r\n\r\nThe player controls a squad of soldiers under the leadership of the hero. In a single-player game, the hero has a story task, which usually requires getting to some point of the game world. On the way to the target, you can occur all sorts of events, and some of them will need the player to make decisions that affect future events.",

    "description": "The Binding Of Isaac is a roguelike top-down “shooter” with RPG elements. Initially, a Flash game, the game had earned many fans due to its unique art style, spooky and catchy ambient music, and almost infinite replayability. Randomly generated levels, loot, and enemies will provide quite a challenge for those unfamiliar with roguelike games, and will bring joy to the eye of an experienced player.\nThe game’s protagonist is Isaac, a child from a religious family. His misadventures are based off a biblical story about a character of the same name, although the gameplay itself certainly does not follow the same footsteps. There are also additional, unlockable characters with unique abilities and traits, which will affect your playthrough’s difficulty. \nThe Binding of Isaac featured non-linear levels, which brought about different outcomes of the game. Depending on the character played, playstyles can also differ, allowing players to create and share new metals for further replayability, and eventual full completion of the game.",

And suddenly the mother heard a voice, which told her that her son is defiled by sins and must be saved. The voice asks the woman to remove all evil from Isaac to save him. There are 12 endings in the game.\n\nBy controlling Isaac or other of the six characters to choose from, the player must go through several levels of the basement, consisting of many rooms that are procedurally generated in the game, and the places are inhabited by hostile creatures with who you have to fight. Inside the rooms, the gameplay is designed as a shooter. The character can shoot to defeat his enemies with tears that he cries while avoiding collisions with them. Also, if the character loses all his health, he does not continue the game from the saved point, he dies. After that, the game starts from the beginning.\n\nThe game will include all the content of the original game, as well as some innovations: a new Chapter, new characters and enemies, as well as new items and rooms.",

    "description": "Oblivion is the fourth part of the acclaimed The Elder Scrolls series. It is set in the high fantasy world of Tamriel, in the Septim Empire. The emperor was recently killed along with his sons, except one that was hidden far from the capital. Before he died, the emperor gave his Amulet of Kings to the protagonist, a prisoner whom the emperor believed to be a future hero he saw in dreams. \r\nThe main character is fully customizable. His or her character class race, gender, age and other attributes are chosen by the player. His quest is to escape prison and find the royal heir. However, since the game is open-world, the player may abandon the central storyline and just wander around Tamriel. You can complete a variety of side quests, join various guilds and factions, or just fight monsters to gain experience. There's an option of \"fast travel\" that allows you to instantly move to an already discovered location.\r\nGame of the Year Edition also contains two expansion packs: Shivering Isles and the Knights of the Nine that expand the game’s storyline. The packs introduce several new locations, two additional factions (the Court of Madness and Knights of the Nine), and a number of new armor, weapons and other items.",

In general, the plot is indirectly connected to previous TES titles, such as Morrowind and Skyrim.\n\nIn fact, The Elder Scrolls Online provides the same gaming experience as offline titles but shared with friends.

You set out to find him. Find a place to rest in, gather food and defend yourself from the natives. Create weapons and survival tools using the game's crafting system. Apart from the animals that inhabit the island, the cannibalistic natives are also present.

Descending down into the caves, the player finds stranger and stranger mutations.\n\nThe tribe isn't always hostile towards the player. Sometimes the locals send patrols to the player's camp, try to communicate with the player. During combat, the tribesmen hide behind cover, protect their wounded comrades or remove torches during the night to avoid detection.",

    "description": "The Long Dark is a game about surviving in the unforgiving conditions of frozen North Canadian taiga. The Arctic wilderness may be breathtakingly beautiful, thanks to the game’s artful visual style, but it is also deadly. Low temperatures, hungry animals like wolves and bears, and starvation can easily kill your character. To stay alive, he will need to learn how to light a campfire, find shelter, care about his wounds, hunt for food and protect himself in an unfriendly environment. Many necessary items in the game, including some of the weapons, need to be crafted out of the junk that you can find in the woods and in abandoned buildings.\nIn the story mode, called Wintermute, you control a pilot, Will Mackenzie, who was hired by his ex-wife Astrid to deliver a mysterious cargo. Eventually, his plane crashed in the woods. Will is injured, and Astrid is missing, presumably lost somewhere in the wilderness. Your goal is to survive and to rescue your companion. Wintermute follows a linear plot and only allows you to explore a limited area. However, it is recommended to start with, since it serves as a sort of tutorial to the open-world sandbox mode. This is the most popular mode, in which you are not confined to the plot and can discover new areas.",

As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.\n\nKey Features\nThe player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.\n\nYou can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.\n\nLead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.\n\nExplore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony’s two planets didn’t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon.",

There is some element of RPG mechanics to the game as players are able to gain experience points. There are 25 Ranks and 10 Speciality Ranks. While ranks are an indication of a player's progress in the game, Speciality Ranks are used in order to level up a specific class. With each new Specialty Rank, there is an Attribute bonus for the player.\n\nDifferent parts of the marine equipment can be replaced in order to change one's stats and customize the playstyle.",

The game follows a female astronaut stranded on the abandoned space research station in a science-fictional universe. Completing the game players will be able to learn more about the fate of researches and to restore the sequence of events held aboard the station. Players assume the role of the protagonist, as she tries to clarify the mystery of a unique item, which allows her to clone herself and to transfer the mind to the clone. Therefore, the cloning ability is a basic game mechanic that helps the player to solve puzzles and complete levels. The gameplay features traditional side-scrolling platformers’ elements: players control the 2D action from the third-person perspective. In the course of the completion, players are going to face obstacles of varying degrees of complexity ranging from simple barriers (however inaccessible for clones) to higher platforms or even gravity shutdowns.",

Of course, the goal of the game is to enter it and reveal its secrets.\nYour way to the Tower lays among turrets you must avoid solving various environmental puzzles. The further you go, the more complicated these puzzles become, turning into long series of actions. You get new abilities and can interact with a larger amount of items, and the game remains challenging during the entire playthrough. \nBased on Greek mythology, The Talos Principle rises such philosophical problems as the humanity of artificial intelligence, androids’ desire to live forever and the confrontation between God and his creatures. These ideas are described in multiple notes, diaries and terminals.",

Being found unconscious on the battlefield he must retrieve his memory and help the emperor's daughter, Adda to stop her from turning in to a feral monster. Facing the biggest enemy, Salamander, Geralt must also help all the fractions around the world to find peace between each other.\n\nThe fighting system is very flexible. Choosing from three different styles, you can adapt Geralt for any kind of a combat situation. Fast style of fighting gives you an opportunity to strike your opponents with your speed. The strong style focuses itself on destroying your enemies with powerful attacks, while sweeping style is very good when facing a number of foes. You can also craft some potions to gain important benefits such as seeing in the dark or having a larger amount HP. Plot style is unique as well. The game never gives a precise definition of evil, which leads the player to convenient situations where the choice is quite bad anyway. Enhanced edition improves every aspect of the game as graphics and the productivity of it, while Director's Cut does the same without censorship for North America's version.",

Puzzles are activated at the grids you can find around locations. \nThere are two modes in the game. In the walking mode you can explore the island, and in the path-drawing mode you don’t move and focus on solving puzzles.\nWhile the game’s plot is quite unclear and The Witness doesn’t give many details on the hero’s background, its key feature is the visual aspect combined with music, inspiring quotes you can hear and the meditative tone of the game in general.

The game is considered a prequel to Bill Willingham's 'Fables' comic book and features usual TellTale stylistics: cartoon-like graphics, comparing your choices to the decisions of the other players and QTEs. 'The Wolf' is the first part of the series with a promised expansion to the second season coming out in 2019.\r\nYou play as Bigby Wolf; he is a Sheriff of a Fabletown: as a typical Sheriff, you need to fulfill the requests of the Fabletown's residents and uncover mysteries lying behind the crimes there. The gameplay consists of choosing the dialogue options, reacting to QTE button-mash and watching cutscenes. \r\nThe critics are marking down that unlike many other TellTale games 'The Wolf Among Us' borrows original comic book's portrayal thus looking better, and having the original as sequel before you eyes lets you engage with Fabula more quickly.",

You play as Garrett, the master thief who awakens after one-year slumber caused by accident in one of his missions. He finds out that his hometown is plagued by a mysterious disease “The Gloom.” \nThe gameplay can be described as first-person stealth-action with the heavy emphasis on the variability of completing missions. Sneaking behind the enemies is usually a more effective way of performing tasks than openly fighting with them. Garrett possesses several different tools and weapons like lockpicks, prybar, etc. One of Garrett’s few weapons is bow which has 8 types of arrows and the full range of application from killing and poisoning enemies to putting out torches and distracting guards.",

The usual order is irrevocably violated, you have to survive, but you are not a soldier and certainly not a superhero.\r\nThe player controls a group of two to four civilians selected from twelve characters. The goal is simple - to survive the war.\r\nLater, new people can join the group. Characters need food, can get sick, freeze, die from wounds. Can run away with all the food stock.\r\nThe day is different from the night in everything. During the day we equip the shelter, repair and produce weapons and tools - from what can be found. In the afternoon we communicate with neighbours, sometimes with benefit. At night we go out for prey. The night harbours us but also harbours looters, often they are armed. Winter brings cold and freezes water, requires more health and firewood.\r\nDecisions that have to be made often have a moral dimension - can one rob an unarmed person if this is a matter of life and death for someone from the group?\r\nAs in life, events are seen as random and do not repeat from game to game. The same characters can behave very differently, and the siege can sometimes last twenty days, and sometimes eighty.",

The wife went to another man, taking the children. On the other hand, the new prosecutor of his town, a young woman, demonstrates sympathy.\nMayor of Freeburg is exactly the one who wants to fire the hero, it was he who determined the terms of his dismissal.\nIn the city there are two mafia groups. And between them a war begins. The hero will have to understand his place in this game as well. For example, ignoring the call of the police, the hero can get money from the mafia.\nThe hero's day begins with sending policemen to the tasks. Policemen can be more or less professional, more or less rested, they have different experiences, and sometimes suffer from alcoholism or have other shortcomings. At the beginning of the game the situation is simple, then complicate. The game depends strategically on the ability to make the best use of police forces.

    "description": "Titan Quest Anniversary Edition is an extended version of the original action role-playing slasher Titan Quest, released in honor of game’s 10th anniversary. The game is set in the world of pre-Roman age and includes 3 locations: Ancient Greece, Egypt, and eastern civilizations. The story begins with a narration about Titans, who ruled the entire world before the Olympians. The idea is that a trio of Telkines managed to break off the communication between Earth and Olympus and started terrorizing the mortal world. The protagonist is a hero, who is expected to defeat Telkines and to restore the conduit linking to worlds. To assume the role of the mythical hero players need to customize their own character: choose the gender and appearance. The further action continues in a traditional hack and slash manner. Players navigate the 3D world through the overhead third-person view and lead the protagonist with the mouse, while special abilities are tied to keyboard buttons. The Anniversary edition includes all possible fixtures and improvements of graphics and gameplay.",

    "description": "A cinematic revival of the series in its action third person form, Tomb Rider follows Lara in her least experience period of life – her youth. Heavily influenced by Naughty Dog’s “Uncharted”, the game is a mix of everything, from stealth and survival to combat and QTE action scenes.\r\nYoung Lara Croft arrives on the Yamatai, lost island near Japan, as the leader of the expedition in search of the Yamatai Kingdom, with a diverse team of specialists. But shipwreck postponed the successful arrival and seemingly forgotten island is heavily populated with hostile inhabitants, cultists of Solarii Brotherhood.\r\nThe game will be graphic at times, especially after failed QTE’s during some of the survival scenes, but overall players will enjoy classic action adventure, reminiscent of the beginning of the series. This game is not a direct sequel or continuation of existing sub-series within the franchise, but a reboot, setting up Tomb Raider to represent modern gaming experience.\r\nThe game has RPG elements and has a world, which you can explore during the story campaign and after the completion. As well as multiplayer mode, where 2 teams (4 scavengers and 4 survivors) are clashing in 3 game modes while using weapons and environments from the single-player campaign.",

The genre itself is well-established already with giants like Diablo series, but Torchlight offers the fresh experience for veterans and newbies alike.\n  The steampunk fantasy world lets players enjoy the lush grass of various beautiful environments, the glowing caves filled with mushrooms, and the endless deserts with their treasures! Lots of different enemies always try their best to stop our adventurers from their goal. From every corner there comes danger, only briefly allowing the players to collect their thoughts and dive yet again in battle with evil.\n  Following Torchlight, the second game starts with chaos erupting from underneath the world. A crazed former hero now takes the lead of hordes of different creatures, and in defeating him and his minions lies the ultimate goal of our new heroes. Take on the mantle of one of the four available classes, and be sure to utilize their might at its fullest. Stay flexible, for the treasure is always surprising, and don’t forget to use your trusty companion as the aid in battle, or as a heavy-packed war mule. Be ready for harsh defeats, or, if you feel like immortal, try the hardest difficulty for the ultimate roguelike challenge. The world of Torchlight is yours to explore!",

    "description": "TrackMania Nations is an arcade-style racing game, the third installment in Nadeo’s TrackMania series. Unlike the other installments in the series, Nations is a free-to-play game that featured in-game advertising as a form of monetization. \n\n###Gameplay \nLike other TrackMania entries, Nations is a racing game with heavy emphasis on player-made content and simplified physics. There is only one car available in the game, which gives every player equal opportunities and accentuates the importance of skill over the right car choice or tuning.\nThe single-player component consists of 100 tracks that gradually get more and more difficult. There is no collision system in the game, so other players or AI opponents do not affect your car’s movement. Depending on the time it took to finish the race, the player gets bronze, silver, or gold medal. Different tracks require a certain amount of medal to unlock. \nEach of the single-player tracks is available for multiplayer alongside the custom tracks that are made with in-game track-editor. \n\n###Forever version \nIn 2008, TrackMania Nations, alongside TrackMania United got free updates with Forever added to their name. The games became network compatible and allowed United owners to play together with Nations players on certain tracks. The Nations’ physics system was updated to match that of United.",

The game bears some resemblance to Tetris with the difference being the objective to stack the blocks instead of clearing rows of them. The rows do not disappear. The game is physics-based, so the player can't win by just dropping the blocks in a random manner. Several in-game events are present, for example, the blocks may drop faster or become slippery. Sometimes the blocks even double in size. You play as a wizard that competes against other wizards and has to build his tower as tall and stable as possible. \n\nIt is possible to cast spells that either assist the players or make the building harder for other wizzards. The players can use 17 spells Throughout a match. Light magic spells are used for making the gameplay easier for the player while Dark magic spells make it harder for your opponents to progress. \n\nThree game modes are present: Race, Puzzle, and Survival. A handful of single-player challenges is also available where the player has to meet certain game conditions to succeed.",

    "description": "Trine II takes a few years after the first game. Successfully saving the kingdom, Amadeus seeks the fireball spells. Yet he is summoned to save the homeland with his friends - Zoya and Pontious. Goblins have taken over the land as they are trying to find the mysterious \"Witch\" deep in the forest. \n\nAlthough having more than one playable character, Trine successfully uses all three of them. Amadeus as the mage is able to move objects or create boxes and planks to help overcome some obstacles. Zoya is very agile so she can hook and grapple on some surfaces, or shoot different targets. Pontious is the strongest character in combat, and he can destroy walls in his path or deflect things with his shield. Having this three different characters, it is necessary to use all three of them to solve puzzles and beat the level. Not only you can play alone, but the game supports three players cooperative to make progress even more atmospheric. \n\nBeautiful design, music and a narrator makes Trine a great story, that feels inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien himself.",

Alone and together they fight with enemies, solve puzzles and overcome obstacles on fifteen different levels. Decisions can be more than one, and they can be composed of the skills of all three players.\nExquisite, delicate drawing of the world and characters. Very elegant, subtle, very realistic sounds - yes, realistic sounds of the magic world. That's precisely the way it should be. But when the hero breaks the wall with a ram or stumbles upon a mountain of treasures - the battering ram sounds like a battering ram, and the mountain is imposing. Very cleverly put light makes the world deep, voluminous and alive. Passing the game, you do not want to rush, you want to consider, to discover all its details, to admire them for your pleasure.\nThe game supports 3D mode, you need a suitable TV and stereoscopic glasses.",

The action takes place in the midst of the cold war, which has an impact on the course of events.\n\nThe primary task is to ensure the fulfillment of five basic needs for each resident: food (the requirement to build farms), housing (if a resident does not have a house, or he has nothing to pay for it, he makes shacks that spoil the beauty of the city and increase crime), religion (construction of temples), entertainment (build bars, cafes, cinemas) and medical support (construction of hospitals)\n\nHow the government provides these aspects to its residents depends on the level of satisfaction of the population, as each need is different for each resident. If the level of happiness is low, the people can go to the rebels. And when the rebels accumulate a lot, they attack various objects, including the Palace. Undermining the Palace means defeat in the game, so in case of a low level of happiness, a vast army has to suppress the riots. But the military, in turn, must also be happy with life. Otherwise, a military coup may occur.",

    "description": "The Game:\nHere is a sandbox like no other. Create massive battles with absolutely no limits. Want to see 10,000 chickens fight an army of Romans?? Sure, why not. Want to see a company of WW2 U.S soldiers fight 11,000 Medieval soldiers?? There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!\nThe Technology:\nUnfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting.\nYes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!",

The combat system inherits the principles, that were introduced in SF III, such as the enhanced special attacks. Special button combos were added to implement fast movement inside an arena. \n\nThere are two energy bars in the game, one of which is used for Super Combos, special attacks called EX Special Moves, and Focus Cancels. The other one is called the Revenge Gauge and is used for executing ultra-combos.\n\n###Ultra Edition features\nThe Ultra Street Fighter was initially released on Japanese arcade machines but was later made available to the general public.

Seven greatest mages sealed the monsters underground and left one entrance through a hole in the Ebott mountain. A lot of time passed since the war, but a human child accidentally falls down the mountain. Its goal is to get back out.\n\nUndertale uses pixelated graphics and traditional mechanics of RPGs such as earning experience points, having an open world, and so on. As the game goes on, the player has to solve several puzzles and interact with NPCs. The battles in the game are represented using the bullet hell mini-games with the player having an option to choose where they want to spare their opponent or hit the enemy back. Monsters behavior depends on the player's actions: if one decides to use a peaceful approach it will be easier to dodge the enemies attacks and vice versa. \n\nThe game features a branching story and several endings. The ending the player gets depends on whether they spared or killed the monsters they encountered throughout the game.",

    "description": "The player controls Yarni, a man of yarn. Yarni arises in the human house, from the tangle of yarn used for knitting by the inhabitants of this house. Yarni moves around the house, goes into the yard, examines the neighborhood. It is small and therefore a mug, flower bed or children's bicycle are obstacles in its way. But the yarn that Yarni is made of is subject to him, he can catch on to the object, pull himself up and climb up, swing and jump, maybe even pull yarn and walk along it like a tightrope walker. The variety of these techniques is large enough, tips help to use them. You can interact with all objects, sometimes there are creatures that can block the path - for example, insects.\nYarn can not be unrolled indefinitely, it is necessary to monitor its consumption. Sometimes you can return the unwound yarn back to the \"body\", sometimes you can increase the amount of yarn, finding a new piece.\nThe most valuable thing Yarni finds is memories. Memories of a family of people, from which he \"comes\" himself. Memories are painted with different emotions, a sufficient number of collected memories opens the entrance to the following levels. In the game there are two lines of events. Events of the past arise as memories, they are found by Yarni. At the same time, the Yarni journey goes in the present - and also serves as a source of events that make up not the past but the present.",

    "description": "Unturned is a low-poly survival game providing single or multiplayer experience. The main action takes place on 6 different maps (Prince Edward Island, Yukon, Washington, Germany and Russia) flooded with zombies. The story begins in the random location of the chosen map and lasts till the death. Playing for one of the few people not yet turned into a zombie, you should stay aware of various natural or unnatural dangers, gather required resources, and make your way through the tough survival. Survivors meet thirst, hunger, disease, injures, zombie bites, and other hostile players looking for safety. Since land, air and sea vehicles are available, players can choose the most suitable transport to explore the entire map. The gameplay stands for the wider opportunity of customization of pretty much everything in the in-game world, starting with simple object destruction and following to guns modification and shelters construction. In-app purchases do not actually affect the gameplay, but due to the cosmetic system, plenty of items (clothing and weapon skins) are purchasable or available in crates.",

During the game they need to solve puzzles, watch animated cutscenes, fight enemies and do military races. \nValiant Hearts is thus telling four stories simultaneously and ties them up in the end and throughout a fabula, while being historically correct when it is crucial.

    "description": "Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure open-world game developed by Ubisoft Montreal. It is the second installment in the series and continues the main idea of its predecessor - hacking and hacktivism in an open world.\n\nWelcome to San-Francisco. It is the second city in the United States to install the city-wide operating system named ctOS, which connects everything from your car to your smart home to a global network. Marcus Holloway is tagged by the system as a suspect for a crime he did not commit. Marcus decides to take action and gets together with the hacktivist group DedSec to expose ctOS and its creators.\n\nWD2 offers the player an immense open world which consists of San-Francisco, Oakland, Marin and Silicon Valley. It's the player's choice to navigate the world on foot or on a wide range of vehicles from cars to boats.\n\nIt is up to the player to choose whether to use a lethal or non-lethal approach on a mission as there is always a taser in your inventory and a billiard ball attached to a paracord that knocks enemies out. \n\nIt is possible to hack into any devices that are connected to ctOS. For instance, Marcus can control forklifts, buzz guards phones in order to distract them.",

    "description": "Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is a singleplayer FPS developed by MachineGames. It is the third installment in the rebooted series.\n\nSet in the alternate 1961 where Nazi Germany won World War II, the game picks up right at the end of Wolfenstein: The New Order. After sustaining heavy injuries in the battle with Wilhelm \"Deathshead\" Strasse, BJ Blaskowicz orders a nuclear strike on Deathshead's compound in order to cripple the Nazi war machine, but he is evacuated by his comrades before the rocket launch. Blaskowicz falls unconscious for 5 months and is woken up by a Nazi attack. The player has to repel the attack and end the Nazi reign over America once and for all.\n\nThe New Colossus features several stealth-action elements, just like the previous title in the series. There are some major differences in the mechanics: now BJ can modify his weaponry on-the-go, dual wield two different weapons at the same time. The cover system makes a comeback. The Protagonist doesn't stick to cover, leaning out of it instead.\n\nThe game offers a linear storyline, but the player is free to complete side-missions in any order they like. Completing these missions is rewarded with new weapon upgrades.",

To combat this scourge, they decide to create a service X-COM (Extraterrestrial Combat Unit ), which is designed to protect humanity from aliens. You play as the head of this service.\n\nThe game is played in two modes: strategic and tactical.\n\nStrategic (Geoscape):\nThe player can manage X-COM bases and change their structure, equip planes, manage research goals: order the delivery of supplies, recruit new staff members, order the production of advanced equipment and sell alien artefacts on the black market for money.\n\nTactical (Battlescape):\nHere the game goes into the phase of tactical combat. You have to command your soldiers, and your primary task is to win the battle against the aliens. Each of the soldiers controlled by the player has many different parameters that determine his abilities.",

    "description": "The game continues the previous game line: XCOM Enemy Unknown. In XCOM 2 we see the Earth under the rule of aliens. The order established by them is based on total control but is proclaimed as the realm of prosperity and security. However, on the periphery of large cities, there are those who consider it a dictatorship and are struggling to restore independence to people. Thus the new XCOM, the organisation of freedom fighters, is reborn. The base for the organisation's soldiers is now the alien ship \"The Avenger\", converted to the needs of the defenders of the Earth.\nThe player will have to travel around the global map, contact guerrillas in various places, look for resources and perform partisan attacks on the critical points of the enemies. The tactics of the organisation have changed - now they are in the minority. The factories for the production of weapons and other equipment were closed 20 years ago, so you have to collect any found equipment and resources.\nThe game introduced many new enemies, but there are aliens from the previous game too. The hero of the game has a unique ability to be in contact with the psi-network uniting all the aliens. This ability makes him a turning point in which the enslavement of the Earth can be reversed.",

You have to fight with the bosses – substantial mutated zombies. In the second mode, Blood Race, the player enters the brutal race. You can chase the cars and take them down.

The last one is Slaughter. You try to survive on different arenas as long as you can. \n\n###Gameplay \nAs for the vehicles, there are 13 types of driving. It includes a fire truck, bulldozer, and tank.\nEvery vehicle feels different, so you can taste it and choose the most convenient one. Upgrading the vehicle on the fly is possible. The game offers the variety of weapons. You can burn zombies with flamethrowers or attack with the launcher. You fight with crowds of zombies at a time, especially in the Slaughter mode. The types of enemies can be unusual: there are zombies dogs, for instance. Medical drops, scattered around the city, can help to manage your health.",

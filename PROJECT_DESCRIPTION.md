**Game Manager: Full-Stack MERN + TypeScript Ecosystem**

A scalable, secure, and strictly typed platform for game catalog management, featuring a hybrid discovery engine and real-time data integration.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Front:** React 18, Vite, CSS Modules (Glassmorphism), React Query, Context API.
- **Back:** Node.js, Express v5, MongoDB (Atlas), Zod, JWT.
- **DevOps:** Docker Compose, Nginx (Reverse Proxy), Multi-Stage Builds, GitHub Actions.
- **APIs:** RAWG (Metadata) + Steam (Prices).

**Key Achievements:**

1.  **Self-Healing Catalog**: Hybrid system that automatically imports and syncs missing games from external APIs in milliseconds.
2.  **Infrastructure as Code**: Fully containerized stack (Frontend + Backend + DB) with Nginx proxying for zero-config deployment.
3.  **Enterprise Security**: Dual-Token Auth (Access/Refresh with Rotation) & "Fail-Fast" validation.
4.  **Optimistic UX**: Instant UI updates for Wishlist/Cart before server confirmation.

**Skills:** System Architecture, Secure API Design, Complex State Sync, and Full-Cycle Development.
